    What the Compendium Covers
   </level_title>
   <paragraph>
    The Compendium documents and explains the many technical requirements, regulations, and legal interpretations of the U.S. Copyright Office with a primary focus on the registration of copyright claims, documentation of copyright ownership, and recordation of copyright documents, including assignments and licenses. It describes the wide range of services that the Office provides for searching, accessing, and
    <page label="1">
    </page>
    retrieving information located in its extensive collection of copyright records and the associated fees for these services. The Compendium provides guidance regarding the contents and scope of particular registrations and records. And it seeks to educate applicants about a number of common mistakes, such as providing incorrect, ambiguous, or insufficient information, or making overbroad claims of authorship.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    The Compendium does not cover every principle of copyright law or detail every aspect of the Office's administrative practices. The Office may, in exceptional circumstances, depart from its normal practices to ensure an outcome that is most appropriate.
   </paragraph>
   <level_title>
    Standard of Deference for the Compendium
   </level_title>
   <paragraph>
    The Compendium does not override any existing statute or regulation. The policies and practices set forth in the Compendium do not in themselves have the force and effect of law and are not binding upon the Register of Copyrights or Copyright Office staff. However, the Compendium does explain the legal rationale and determinations of the Copyright Office, where applicable, including circumstances where there is no controlling judicial authority.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    The Supreme Court recognized that courts may consider the interpretations set forth in administrative manuals, policy statements, and similar materials "to the extent that those interpretations have 'the power to persuade.”

    (applying "power to persuade" standard to the Compendium). The weight of [the agency's] judgment . . . in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade . . . .”

    First and Second Editions of the Compendium
   </level_title>
   <paragraph>
    The first edition of the Compendium (commonly referred to as "Compendium I") governed the Office's general practices for registration, recordation, and other matters arising under the Copyright Act of 1909. Largely an internal manual, it was directed to the Office's examining staff. Compendium I was made available to the public for the first time in 1967 and it was last revised in 1973. See
    <ref edition="1st" source="compendium" year="1973">

    </a>
    .
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    The second edition of the Compendium (commonly referred to as "Compendium II") was also designed for internal use. Compendium II reflects the Copyright Office's general practices for registration, recordation, and other matters arising under the Copyright Act of 1976, prior to the adoption of the Third Edition. It was first published in 1984 and revised in part in 1988 and 1998. In 1988 the Office added Chapter 600 (Registration Procedures) and Chapter 1900 (Records, Indexes and Deposits). In 1995 the Office amended Chapter 600, § 606.04, which discussed the procedure for requesting reconsideration of a refusal to register. In 1998 the Office revised Chapter 1600 (Recordation of Transfers) and Chapter 1900 (Records, Indexes, and Deposits). See generally

    Although the Copyright Act of 1909 was repealed effective January 1, 1978, Compendium II did not supersede Compendium I. The preface to Compendium II expressly stated that Compendium I continued "to apply to Copyright Office actions, in situations . . . where the provisions of the Copyright Act of 1909, as amended, are dispositive."

    . In other words, Compendium I remained the governing administrative manual for all registrations, renewals, and recordations issued by the Office prior to January 1, 1978. It also set forth the registration requirements for works published before January 1, 1978 where the applicant subsequently sought to register the work for the original copyright term (i.e., the first twenty-eight years of the copyright), including issues involving copyright notice and the manufacturing clause.

    Relationship Between the First, Second, and Third Editions of the Compendium
   </level_title>
   <paragraph>
    This version of the Third Edition governs registrations and recordations issued by the U.S. Copyright Office on or after January 28, 2021. Registrations and recordations issued between December 22, 2014 and January 27, 2021 are generally governed by the prior versions of the Third Edition, except in cases where those versions have been superseded by an amendment to the regulations, intervening case law, or previously announced changes in practice.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    To the extent there is a conflict between the Third Edition and Compendiums I or II, the current version shall control. That said, the Third Edition does not comprehensively cover all of the Office's practices under the prior copyright law. To the extent that issues arise that are not addressed by the Third Edition, Compendiums I and II remain in effect and continue to be the governing administrative manuals for practices involving those issues.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    In particular, the Third Edition generally does not address practices under the Copyright Act of 1909. Compendium I continues to be the controlling manual for registrations, renewals, and recordations issued by the Office prior to January 1, 1978, and for the registration requirements for works published before January 1, 1978 that were never registered for the original copyright term. For ease of reference, however, Chapter
    <a href="/compendium/ch2100-renewal-registration.html">
     2100
    </a>
    of the Third Edition summarizes most of the relevant practices from Compendium I concerning the registration and renewal of such works.
   </paragraph>
   <paragraph>
    Similarly, the Third Edition does not address all practices involving provisions of the Copyright Act of 1976 that have been amended or repealed since 1978. As a general rule, Compendium II continues to be the relevant administrative manual for registrations, renewals, and recordations issued by the Office between January 1, 1978 and December 22, 2014. In particular, Chapter 1200 of Compendium II continues to be the governing manual concerning the manufacturing clause, although that Chapter only applies to works published before June 30, 1986, which is the date that the manufacturing clause expired.
   </paragraph>
   <level_title>
    Using the Compendium
   </level_title>
   <paragraph>
    The U.S. Copyright Office makes the Compendium available in PDF format. The complete manual may be accessed or downloaded in its entirety or on a chapter-by-chapter basis. Each chapter can be accessed through the link set forth in the table of contents for the Compendium as a whole. Additionally, the Compendium includes a glossary of terms that are commonly used in registration and recordation practice. These terms are defined and linked throughout the chapters. Certain frequently used phrases are defined for convenience.
