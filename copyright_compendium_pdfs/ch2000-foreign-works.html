        <section_title><num>2001</num> What This Chapter Covers</section_title>
        <paragraph>This Chapter explains when authors of foreign works may apply to register their works
with the U.S. Copyright Office. This Chapter applies to unpublished works regardless of
when they were created, and to published works that were first published on or after
January 1, 1978.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This Chapter also discusses Form GATT, which may be used to register a restored work
that is eligible for copyright protection under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act .
Restored works comprise a small subset of foreign works, and applicants must use Form
GATT to register these types of wo rks with the Office.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>2002.1</num> What Is a Foreign Work?</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>For purposes of copyright registration, the term “ foreign works ” generally refers to
works created by author(s) who are not U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals and/or works that
were first published abroad. Generally, the author is the person or perso ns who actually
created the material that the applicant intends to register. There is an exception to this
rule if the work is a work made for hire . For a definition and discussion of works made
for hire, see Chapter 500 , Section 506.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>U.S. citizens are people who are citizens in accordance with the U.S. Consti tution or
federal statutes, including (i) people born in Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto
Rico; and (ii) certain people who are by federal statute nationals, but not citizens of the
United States, including people born in the outlying possessions of the United States. All
U.S. citizens are also U.S. nationals. Works by U.S. citizens and nationals are not
considered foreign works, and generally they are eligible for U.S. copyright protection.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The types of works that may be protected under the Copyri ght Act include literary
works ; musical works, including any accompanying words; dramatic works, including
any accompanying music; pantomimes and choreographic works ; pictorial, graphic, and
sculptural works ; motion pictures and other audiovisual works ; sound recordings ; and
arch itectural works ; as well as derivative works , compilations , and collectiv e works . For
a definition and discussion of these types of works, see Chapter 500 , Sections 507
(Derivative Works), 508 (Compilations), and 509 (Collective Works), and Chapters 700
(Literary Works), 800 (Works of the Performing Arts), and 900 (Visual Art Works).</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>2002.2</num> Treatment of Foreign Works</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>In the vast majority of cases, a foreign work may be registered with the U.S. Copyright
Office if it satisfies the eligibility requirements discussed in Section 2003 . However, this
does not mean that foreign works are treated exactly the s ame as domestic works. U.S.
law applies whenever a United States work or a foreign work is involved in a copyright
infringement lawsuit in this country. Before the copyright owner can file a laws uit
involving an infringement of a U.S. work, the work must be registered with the Office or
the Office must issue a refusal to register that work. In addition, U.S. works must be
registered in a timely manner to seek statutory damages and attorney’s fees. By
contrast, foreign works do not need to be registered (or refused registration) in order to
file an infringement lawsuit in the United States, though they must be registered in a
timely manner to seek statutory damages and attorney’s fees.</paragraph>

Eligible for Registration with the U.S. Copyright Office</section_title>
        <paragraph>Section 104 of the Copyright Act sets forth the categories of foreign works that are
eligible for copyright protection under U.S. law. This Section describes each of these
categories.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Works first published in a foreign country are eligible for registration with the U.S.
Copyright Office if they satisfy one or more of the conditions described in Sections
2003.2(A) through 2003.2(F) .</paragraph>

                <paragraph><ref source="USC" cite="Section 104(b)(1)">Section 104(b)(1)</ref> of the Copyright Act protects foreign works if, upon the work’s first
publication , one or more author(s) of the work (i) is a national or domiciliary of the
United States; (ii) is a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of a treaty party ; or
(iii) is a stateless perso n wherever that person is domiciled.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>A “sovereign authority” is a governmental agency or subdivision of a foreign nation,
such as a ministry of the government of Norway or a province of Canada. A “stateless
person” is a person who has no nationality, eith er as the result of never having acquired
nationality in any nation, or as the result of having effectively renounced or having been
deprived of his or her former nationality without having, as yet, become a national of
another nation.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Chapter 1900 generally discusses the concept of when a work is published . The concept
of “first publication” is further defined in <ref source="USC" cite="Section 104(b)">Section 104(b)</ref> of the Copyright Act, which
explains that “a work that is published in the United States or a treaty party within
thirty days after publication in a foreign nation that is not a treaty party shall be
considered to be first published in the United States or such treaty party, as the case
may be.”</paragraph>
                <paragraph>This means that a foreign work may be eligible for copyright protection in a wide variety
of cases. Aside from U.S. nationals and domiciliaries, authors who are nationals or
domiciliaries of any trea ty party at the time of first publication can obtain U.S.
protection for a foreign work. As discussed in Section 2004 , the United States has
entered into treaty relations with all but a handful of countries, meaning that the
majori ty of foreign works will be eligible for protection under <ref source="USC" cite="Section 104(b)">Section 104(b)</ref> of the
Copyright Act.</paragraph>

published in (i) the United States, or (ii) a foreign nation that, on the date of the first
publication , is a treaty party . In other words, regardless of the nationality or domicile of
the author(s), a work may be eligible for protection under the Copyright Ac t if it is first
published in the United States or in any nation that has a relevant treaty with the United
States at the time of the first publication. For more information on which countries are
treaty partners, see Section 2004 .</paragraph>
                <level_title>NOTE:</level_title>
                <paragraph>There is an exception to this rule. A work that was first published in a foreign
nation that has not entered into a treaty with the United States may be eligible for
protection in this country if the work was published within thirty days thereafter in the
United States or in a foreign nation that is a treaty party. This exception was added to
the Copyright Act effective October 28, 1998, and it applies to any work that was first
published on or after September 28, 1998. See <ref source="PUB_LAW" cite="Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Section 102, 112 Stat. 2860, 2862 (1998)">Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Section

protection to works by nationals or domiciliaries of the United States or works that are

        <paragraph>U.S. protection of foreign works often is based on the United States’ treaty relationships
with other countries. The United States has treaty relationships with all but a handful of
countries, as set forth in <ref source="OTHER" cite="International Copyright Relations of the United States (Circular 38a)">Inter national Copyright Relations of the United States (Circular
38a)</ref> . Some of these treaties are multilateral, meaning that there are more than two
parties to the treaty, while other treaties are bilateral, meaning that they are between
just the United States and one foreign country. It is important to note the date on which a
foreign country became a treaty party, because U.S. law will apply only to works either</paragraph>
        <paragraph>created or first published (depending on which type of eligibility is used) on or after the
date th at the foreign country became a treaty party . Additionally, for a treaty to confer
eligibility, it must apply to the work at issue. For example, an author of a literary work
could not rely on the existence of a copyright treaty that protects only satellite
broadcasts but not literary works.</paragraph>

following:</paragraph>
            <list>
                <item>• Buenos Aires Convention of 1910: This was an early treaty that provided certain
copyright protections for artistic and literary works and was deposited with the

                <item>• The Agreement on Trade­Related Aspects of Intellectual Property R ights (“TRIPS”)
was entered into as part of the World Trade Organization (“WTO”), established
pursuant to the Marrakesh Agreement of April 15, 1994, which implemented the
Uruguay Round Agreements. TRIPS incorporated the Berne Convention in most
part, cover ed copyright and other intellectual property rights, and included</item>
                <item>provisions relating to enforcement of intellectual property rights. The effective date
of United States membership in the WTO is January 1, 1995.</item>
                <item>• The Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons Who Are
Blind, Visually Impaired or Otherwise Print Disabled (“Marrakesh VIP Treaty”)
provides an obligation for member nations to provide copyright limitations and
exceptions in order to permit reproduction, distribution and m aking available of
published works in formats designed to be accessible to visually impaired people,
and to permit exchange of these works across borders by eligible organizations that
serve those beneficiaries. The provisions of this treaty were implement ed into U.S.
law with the Marrakesh Treaty Implementation Act on October 10, 2018. U.S.
membership in the treaty came into force on May 8, 2019. For more information on

using a paper a pplication ( e.g., Form TX , PA, VA, SR, SE, etc.). For specific guidance on
how to complete these applications, see Chapter 600 (Examination Practices). There are,
however, some foreign works that must be registered with a paper application
submitted on Form GATT. These works typically were created or published before 1996
and are known as “restored works,” which are discussed in Section 2007 below.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>Previously, U.S. federal copyright law did not protect original works of authorship
immediately upon their fixation in a tangible medium of expression. Instead, author s
needed to take certain steps, such as publishing the work with a specific copyright
notice and renewing the copyrights at particular times in order to obtain federal
copyright protection. These types of requirements are called “formalities” and they
applied to both U.S. and foreign works.</paragraph>
        </subsection>
        <paragraph>In 1978, the current Copyright Act went into effect, which eliminated some of these
requirements. In 1989, the United States became a member of the Berne Convention ,
and enacted the Uruguay Round Agreements Act , <ref source="PUB_LAW" number="103-465" cite="Pub. L. No. 103 –465, 108 Stat. 4809 (codified in scattered sections of the U.S.C .) (1994)">Pub. L.

United States’ obligations under the Agreement on Trade -Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights. This further relaxed some of the Copyright Act’s more restrictive
provisions.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Specifically, the URAA “restor ed” the copyright in foreign works that entered the public
domain because of a failure to comply with certain formalities, and thus provided
retroactive copyright protection for many works that were ineligible for protection
under the prior law. In 2012, t he U.S. Supreme Court held that the URAA does not violate
Article I, Section 8 or the First Amendment of the Constitution. <ref source="CASE" case_name="Golan v. Holder" reporter="565 U.S." page="302" court_year="2012">Golan v. Holder , <ref source="CASE" volume="565 U.S." page="302" court_year="2012">565 U.S. 302 (2012)</ref></ref>.</paragraph>

U.S.C. § 104A(h)(6)(B)</ref> . As discussed in Chapter 100 , Section 102.2(A), the term of
protection is the length of time during which a work is protected by copyright law.
As discussed in Chapter 300 , Section 313.6(D), the term “public domain” means that
the work is not protected by copyright law. Thus, a restored work must be
copyright -protected and still within its term of protection in the foreign country.</item>
            <item>• Fell into the public domain in the United States : The work must be in the public
domain in the United States (i) because the work did not comply with certain
formalities (such as failing to place a proper notice on the work, failing to renew the
copyright in a timely manner, or failing to comply with manufacturing requirements
under prior law); (ii) because the work is a sound recording that was fixed before
February 15, 1972, and as such, was not protected by U.S. federal copyright law; or
(iii) because of a lack of national eligibility (as discussed above generally). <ref source="USC" cite="17 U.S.C. § 104A(h)(6)(C)">17 U.S.C.
§ 104A(h)(6)(C)</ref> .</item>

work must have been (i) a national or domiciliary of an eligible country at the time
of the work’s creation , and (ii) if the work is published , it must have been first
published in an eligible country and not published in the United States within thirty
