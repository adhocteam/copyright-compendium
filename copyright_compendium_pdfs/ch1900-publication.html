  <section_title><num>1902</num> What Constitutes Publication?</section_title>
  <paragraph><ref source="uscode" title="17" section="101">Section 101</ref> of the Copyright Act defines publication as "the distribution of copies or phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending." <ref source="uscode" title="17" section="101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref>. It states that "offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution, public performance, or public display, constitutes publication." Id. It also explains that "[a] public performance or display of a work does not of itself constitute publication.” Id.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>The legislative history explains that "a work is 'published' if one or more copies or phonorecords embodying [the work] are distributed to the public” with “no explicit or implicit restrictions with respect to [the] disclosure of [the] contents [of that work]." <ref source="house-report" number="94-1476" page="138" year="1976">H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 138 (1976)</ref>, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5754. It also explains that publication occurs "when copies or phonorecords are offered to a group of wholesalers, broadcasters, motion picture theatres, etc.” for the purpose of "further distribution, public performance, or public display." Id.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Although it is not expressly stated in the statutory definition, the legislative history indicates that publication occurs only (i) when copies or phonorecords are distributed by or with the authority of the copyright owner, or (ii) when an offer to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for further distribution, public performance, or public display is made by or with the authority of the copyright owner. For a definition and discussion of the terms “copies” and “phonorecords," see <a href="/compendium/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.html#sec-305">Chapter 300, Section 305</a>.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for further distribution, public performance, or public display without authorization does not constitute publication. Likewise, an unauthorized distribution of copies or phonorecords does not constitute publication. Instead it generally constitutes copyright <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#infringement">infringement</a>. See <ref source="house-report" number="94-1476" page="62" year="1976">H.R. REP.

  <section_title><num>1903</num> The Significance of Publication</section_title>
  <paragraph>Publication is an important concept for works created or first published after January 1, 1978 for a number of reasons:</paragraph>
  <list>
   <item>• If the work has been published, the date and nation of first publication should be provided in the application to register that work with the U.S. Copyright Office. See <ref source="uscode" title="17" section="409" subsection="8">17 U.S.C. § 409(8)</ref>.

   <item>• The year of publication may determine the length of the copyright term if the work was created before January 1, 1978, and was first published between January 1, 1978 and January 1, 2003. See <ref source="uscode" title="17" section="303" subsection="a">17 U.S.C. § 303(a)</ref>.</item>
   <item>• A <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#certificate_of_registration">certificate of registration</a> constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and the facts stated in the certificate of registration, provided that the work is registered before or within five years after the work is first published. <ref source="uscode" title="17" section="410" subsection="c">17 U.S.C. § 410(c)</ref>.</item>
   <item>• The copyright owner may be entitled to claim statutory damages and attorney's fees in an <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#infringement">infringement</a> lawsuit, provided that the work was registered before the infringement began or within three months after the first publication of the work.

  <section_title><num>1904</num> General Policies Concerning Publication</section_title>
  <paragraph>This Section discusses the U.S. Copyright Office's general practices and procedures for examining <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#published">published</a> and <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#unpublished">unpublished</a> works.</paragraph>
  <subsection label="1904.1" id="subsec-1904-1">
   <subsection_title><num>1904.1</num> Applicant Makes the Determination</subsection_title>
   <paragraph>The <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">applicant</a>—not the U.S. Copyright Office—must determine whether a work is published or unpublished.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Act is the exclusive source of copyright protection in the United States, and all applicants — both foreign and domestic — must demonstrate that a work satisfies the requirements of U.S. copyright law to register a work with the Office. Determining whether a work is published or unpublished should be based on U.S. copyright law under Title 17, and it should be based on the facts that exist at the time the application is filed with the Office, even if the work was created in a foreign country, first published in a foreign country, or created by a citizen, domiciliary, or habitual resident of a foreign country.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>Upon request, the Office will provide the applicant with general information about the provisions of the Copyright Act, including the statutory definition of publication, and will explain the relevant practices and procedures for registering a published or unpublished work with the Office. The Office will not give specific legal advice on whether a particular work has or has not been published. However, if an assertion is clearly contrary to facts known by the Office, a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claim">claim</a> may be questioned, or in certain situations, refused.</paragraph>
  </subsection>
  <subsection label="1904.2" id="subsec-1904-2">
   <subsection_title><num>1904.2</num> Facts Stated in the Application</subsection_title>
   <paragraph>As a general rule, the U.S. Copyright Office will not conduct its own factual investigation to determine whether a work is published or unpublished or to confirm the truth of the statements made in the application concerning publication.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>Ordinarily, the Office will accept the facts stated in the application, unless they are implausible or conflict with information provided elsewhere in the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#registration_materials">registration materials</a>, the Office's records, or other sources of information that are known by the Office.</paragraph>
  </subsection>
  <subsection label="1904.3" id="subsec-1904-3">
   <subsection_title><num>1904.3</num> Claim in a Published or Unpublished Work Contradicted by Information Provided Elsewhere, such as in the Registration Materials</subsection_title>
   <paragraph>As a general rule, if the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">applicant</a> affirmatively states that the work is unpublished or fails to provide a date of first publication in the application, the Office will register the work as an unpublished work, unless the information provided in the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#deposit_copy">deposit copy</a> or in other sources of information known by the Office clearly indicate that the work has been published.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>Likewise, if the applicant affirmatively states that the work has been published and provides a date of first publication in the application, the Office generally will register the work as a published work, unless information provided in the deposit copies or in other sources of information known by the Office clearly suggest that the work is unpublished.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>If the deposit copy(ies) or other information known by the Office clearly suggest that the work is published or unpublished and if it appears that the applicant provided or failed to provide a date of publication by mistake, the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#registration_specialist">registration specialist</a> may communicate with the applicant. For examples of situations that may prompt a communication concerning publication, see <a href="/compendium/ch600-examination-practices.html">Chapter 600</a>, <a href="/compendium/ch600-examination-practices.html#prov-612-7-A">Sections 612.7(A)</a> and <a href="/compendium/ch600-examination-practices.html#prov-612-7-B">612.7(B)</a>.</paragraph>

  <section_title><num>1905</num> Distribution of Copies or Phonorecords of a Work</section_title>
  <paragraph>As discussed in <a href="#sec-1902">Section 1902</a>, publication occurs when one or more <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copies">copies</a> or <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#phonorecords">phonorecords</a> of a work are distributed to the public by or with the authority of the copyright owner. These issues are discussed in <a href="#subsec-1905-1">Sections 1905.1</a> through <a href="#subsec-1905-3">1905.3</a> below.</paragraph>
  <subsection label="1905.1" id="subsec-1905-1">
   <subsection_title><num>1905.1</num> Distribution to the Public</subsection_title>
   <paragraph><ref source="uscode" title="17" section="101">Section 101</ref> of the Copyright Act states a work is published when <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copies">copies</a> or <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#phonorecords">phonorecords</a> of that work are distributed "to the public." <ref source="uscode" title="17" section="101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref>. Specifically, publication occurs when one or more copies or phonorecords are distributed to a member of the public who is not subject to any express or implied restrictions concerning the disclosure of the content of that work. If a work exists only in one copy — such as a painting embodied solely in a canvas — the work may be considered published if that copy is distributed to the public with the authorization of the copyright owner. <ref source="house-report" number="94-1476" page="61, 138" year="1976">H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 61, 138 (1976)</ref>, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5754, 5675 (stating that "[t]he reference to 'copies and phonorecords,' although in the plural, are intended . . . to include the singular.").</paragraph>
   <paragraph>Examples:</paragraph>
   <list>
    <item>• Selling copies of a textbook to a local school board constitutes publication of that work.</item>
    <item>• Selling a product with <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyrightable">copyrightable</a> artwork on the packaging and label constitutes publication of that artwork.</item>
    <item>• Mailing copies of a catalog to potential customers constitutes publication of that catalog and any unpublished works revealed in that work.</item>
    <item>• Distributing copies of a leaflet on a street corner constitutes publication of that work.</item>
    <item>• Transmitting a copy of an illustration to a client constitutes publication of that work, if the copyright owner authorized the client to use that image and did not impose any restrictions on the client's ability to disclose that work to the public.</item>
    <item>• Giving away copies of a photograph without further restriction constitutes publication of that work.</item>
    <item>• Lending, renting, or leasing copies of a work constitutes publication of that work.</item>
    <item>• Distributing copies of a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#motion_picture">motion picture</a> through a retail service constitutes publication of that work.</item>
    <item>• Selling the original copy of a painting at an auction.</item>
   </list>
   <paragraph>If an actual distribution has not occurred, the work is considered unpublished. Likewise, a work is considered unpublished if the copies or phonorecords were not distributed to a member of the public, but instead were much more restricted, including an exchange between family members or social acquaintances.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>The courts created the doctrine of "limited publication" to distinguish certain distributions from a "general publication" and to avoid the divestive consequences of publication without notice when it was clear the author (or copyright proprietor) restricted both the purpose and the recipients of the distribution. Generally, a limited publication is the distribution of copies of a work to a definitely selected group with a limited purpose and without the right of diffusion, reproduction, distribution, or sale. A limited publication is not considered a distribution to the public and, therefore, is not publication. See <ref source="case" reporter="F.2d" volume="193" page="744">White v. Kimmell, 193 F.2d 744, 746-47 (9th Cir. 1952)</ref> (explaining that a publication is limited if it “communicates the contents of a [work] to a definitely selected group and for a limited purpose, and without the right of diffusion, reproduction, distribution or sale ... [and is] restricted both as to persons and purpose.").</paragraph>
   <paragraph>Examples:</paragraph>
   <list>
    <item>• Sending copies of a manuscript to prospective publishers in an effort to secure a book contract does not constitute publication (regardless of whether the copies are returned).</item>
    <item>• Distributing copies of a research paper that are intended solely for the use of the participants at a seminar generally does not constitute publication if there was no right of further diffusion, reproduction, distribution, or sale by the participants.</item>
    <item>• Distributing copies of a speech that are intended solely to assist the press in covering that event has been deemed a limited publication under the Copyright Act of 1909 (i.e., not a publication). However, under the current statutory definition, offering to distribute copies to different news outlets for the purpose of further distribution, public performance, or public display could constitute publication.</item>
   </list>
   <paragraph>Moreover, a work may be considered unpublished if, in addition to communicating a work to a definitely selected group and for a limited purpose, the copyright owner imposed any express or implied restrictions concerning the disclosure of the content of that work, such as placing a statement on the copies or phonorecords indicating that distribution of the work is limited or restricted in some way, such as “Confidential— these specifications are for internal office use only."</paragraph>

  <subsection label="1905.2" id="subsec-1905-2">
   <subsection_title><num>1905.2</num> The Means of Distribution</subsection_title>
   <paragraph>As discussed in <a href="#sec-1902">Section 1902</a>, publication occurs when <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copies">copies</a> or <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#phonorecords">phonorecords</a> are distributed to the public by means of a sale or other <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#transfer">transfer</a> of ownership, such as giving copies away. Likewise, publication occurs when copies or phonorecords are distributed by means of rental, lease, or lending (i.e., where the copies or phonorecords change hands, but there is no change in the ownership of those copies or phonorecords).</paragraph>
   <paragraph>Distributing copies or phonorecords by any other means does not constitute publication. In particular, the legislative history states that "any form or dissemination in which a material object does not change hands... is not a publication no matter how many people are exposed to the work." <ref source="house-report" number="94-1476" page="138" year="1976">H.R.

   <paragraph><ref source="uscode" title="17" section="101">Section 101</ref> of the Copyright Act states that "offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution, public performance, or public display constitutes publication." <ref source="uscode" title="17" section="101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref>. Specifically, publication occurs when one or more copies or phonorecords are offered to wholesalers, retailers, broadcasters, aggregators, or similar intermediaries for the purpose of distributing the work to the public or for the purpose of publicly performing or publicly displaying the work. If a work exists only in one copy, the work may be considered published if that copy is offered to a group of persons with the authorization of the copyright owner. <ref source="house-report" number="94-1476" page="61, 138" year="1976">H.R.

   <paragraph>Examples:</paragraph>
   <list>
    <item>• Publication occurs when a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#motion_picture">motion picture</a> is offered to a group of movie theaters or television networks for the purpose of exhibiting or broadcasting that work.</item>
    <item>• Publication occurs when copies of a greeting card are offered to retailers for the purpose of selling those copies to the public.</item>
    <item>• Publication occurs when copies of a photograph are offered to clients, including but not limited to newspapers, magazines, agencies, wire services, and websites with a license permitting further distribution or display of the photograph.</item>
    <item>• Publication occurs when phonorecords are offered radio stations for the purpose of broadcasting the songs and <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#sound_recordings">sound recordings</a> embodied therein.</item>
    <item>• Publication occurs when copies of a song are offered to a group of band directors for the purpose of performing that work at athletic events.</item>
    <item>• Publication occurs when fabric, carpet, or wallpaper samples are offered to sales representatives for the purpose of selling those works to wholesalers and retailers.</item>
    <item>• Publication occurs when the original copy of a statue is offered to a group of museums for the purpose of publicly displaying the work.</item>
   </list>
   <paragraph>Offering a work directly to the public constitutes publication where the offeror has completed all the steps necessary for distribution to the public, such that the only further action required is an offeree's action in obtaining a copy or phonorecord. By contrast, offering a work directly to the public does not constitute publication where distribution of copies or phonorecords requires additional action by the offeror.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>Examples:</paragraph>
   <list>
    <item>• If an author places copies of their new short story in a library book exchange box at the end of their driveway this constitutes publication of that short story.</item>
    <item>• An online advertisement that offers to sell an ebook to the public, but does not make the ebook available for download, does not constitute publication of that ebook.</item>
    <item>• An offer by the copyright owner on a public website to purchase and download an app that they developed and made accessible on that website constitutes publication of that app.</item>
    <item>• An advertisement containing pictures of a jewelry design constitutes publication of that work, but an advertisement that merely contains a textual description of that design does not.</item>

   <paragraph><ref source="uscode" title="17" section="101">Section 101</ref> of the Copyright Act states that performing or displaying a work "publicly" means:</paragraph>
   <list>
    <item>• "[T]o perform or display it at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered; or"</item>
    <item>• "[T]o transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to a place specified [in the preceding paragraph] or to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times."</item>
   </list>
   <paragraph><ref source="uscode" title="17" section="101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref>.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>Although the statute does not define the term “public,” it "suggests that 'the public' consists of a large group of people outside of a family and friends,” such as "a large number of people who are unrelated and unknown to each other.” <ref source="case" reporter="S. Ct." volume="134" page="2498">American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. v. Aereo, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2498, 2509-10 (U.S. 2014)</ref>.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>The legislative history explains that a performance or display constitutes a public performance or a public display if it occurs "in a public place.” It also explains that a performance or display that occurs in a "semipublic" place, such as a club, lodge, factory, summer camp, or school, is considered a public performance or display. <ref source="house-report" number="94-1476" page="64" year="1976">H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 64 (1976)</ref>, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5677-78.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>By contrast, a performance or display that occurs at "a gathering confined to [an] individual's social acquaintances would normally be regarded as private." Id. A performance or display that occurs during "[r]outine meetings of businesses and governmental personnel” would be normally considered private "because they do not represent the gathering of a 'substantial number of persons.” Id., reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5678. Likewise, “an entity does not transmit [a work] to the public if it does not transmit to a substantial number of people outside of a family and its social circle." <ref source="case" reporter="S. Ct." volume="134" page="2511">American Broadcasting Companies, 134 S. Ct. at 2511</ref>.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>The legislative history further explains that a public performance or a display includes "the initial rendition or showing" of a work, as well as “any further act by which that rendition or showing is transmitted or communicated to the public." <ref source="house-report" number="94-1476" page="63" year="1976">H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 63</ref>, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5676. “[F]or example, a sing[er] is performing when he or she sings a song; a broadcasting network is performing when it transmits [that] performance (whether simultaneously or from records); a local broadcaster is performing when it transmits the network broadcast; a cable television system is performing when it retransmits the broadcast to its subscribers; and any individual is performing whenever he or she plays a phonorecord embodying the performance or communicates the performance by turning on a receiving set." Id., reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5676-77.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>A performance or display that is transmitted to the public is considered a public performance or a public display "even though the recipients are not gathered in a single place, and even if there is no proof that any of the potential recipients was operating his receiving apparatus at the time of the transmission.” Id. at 64-65, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5678. "In other words, 'the public' need not be situated together, spatially or temporally" for a public performance or public display to occur. <ref source="case" reporter="S. Ct." volume="134" page="2510">American Broadcasting Companies, 134 S. Ct. at 2510</ref>.</paragraph>
   <paragraph>Moreover, "when an entity communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to multiple people, it transmits a performance to them regardless of the number of discrete communications it makes.” <ref source="case" reporter="S. Ct." volume="134" page="2509">Id. at 2509</ref>. For instance, when an entity "streams the same television program to multiple subscribers, it 'transmit[s]... a performance' to all of them," regardless of whether the entity makes the transmission "from the same or separate copies" or from "user-specific copies.” Id. (quoting <ref source="uscode" title="17" section="101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref> (definition of "perform or display a work 'publicly")).</paragraph>
