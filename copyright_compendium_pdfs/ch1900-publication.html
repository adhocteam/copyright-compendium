        <section_title><num>1902</num> What Constitutes Publication?</section_title>
        <paragraph>Section 101 of the Copyright Act defines publication as “the distribution of copies or phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending.” <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="101" cite="17 U.S.C. § 101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref>. It states that “offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution, public performance, or public display, constitutes publication.” Id. It also explains that “[a] public performance or display of a work does not of itself constitute publication.” Id.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The legislative history explains that “a work is ‘published’ if one or more copies or phonorecords embodying [the work] are distributed to the public” with “no explicit or implicit restrictions with respect to [the] disclosure of [the] contents [of that work].” <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="138" year="1976" cite="H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 138 (1976)">H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 138 (1976)</ref>, reprinted in <ref source="USCCAN" year="1976" page="5754" cite="1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5754">1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5754</ref>. It also explains that publication occurs “when copies or phonorecords are offered to a group of wholesalers, broadcasters, motion picture theatres, etc.” for the purpose of “further distribution, public performance, or public display.” Id.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Although it is not expressly stated in the statutory definition, the legislative history indicates that publication occurs only (i) when copies or phonorecords are distributed by or with the authority of the copyright owner, or (ii) when an offer to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for further distribution, public performance, or public display is made by or with the authority of the copyright owner. For a definition and discussion of the terms “copies” and “phonorecords,” see Chapter 300, Section 305.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for further distribution, public performance, or public display without authorization does not constitute publication. Likewise, an unauthorized distribution of copies or phonorecords does not constitute publication. Instead it generally constitutes copyright infringement. See <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="62" year="1976" cite="H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 62 (1976)">H.R. REP.

        <section_title><num>1903</num> The Significance of Publication</section_title>
        <paragraph>Publication is an important concept for works created or first published after January 1, 1978 for a number of reasons:</paragraph>
        <list>
            <item>If the work has been published, the date and nation of first publication should be provided in the application to register that work with the U.S. Copyright Office. See <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="409" subsection="8" cite="17 U.S.C. § 409(8)">17 U.S.C. § 409(8)</ref>. For guidance in completing this portion of the application, see Chapter 600, Sections 612 and 617.</item>
            <item>The deposit requirements for registering a published work differ from the requirements for registering an unpublished work. For information concerning these requirements, see Chapter 1500, Sections 1503 and 1505.</item>
            <item>Works first published in the United States may be subject to mandatory deposit with the Library of Congress. For information concerning the mandatory deposit requirements, see Chapter 1500, Section 1511.</item>
            <item>The year of publication may determine the length of the copyright term for a work made for hire. For a definition and discussion of works made for hire, see Chapter 500, Section 506.</item>
            <item>The year of publication may determine the length of the copyright term for an anonymous work or a pseudonymous work, unless the author’s identity is revealed in records maintained by the U.S. Copyright Office. For a definition and discussion of anonymous works and pseudonymous works, see Chapter 600, Sections 615.1 and 615.2.</item>
            <item>The year of publication may determine the length of the copyright term if the work was created before January 1, 1978, and was first published between January 1, 1978 and January 1, 2003. See <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="303" subsection="a" cite="17 U.S.C. § 303(a)">17 U.S.C. § 303(a)</ref>.</item>
            <item>A certificate of registration constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and the facts stated in the certificate of registration, provided that the work is registered before or within five years after the work is first published. <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="410" subsection="c" cite="17 U.S.C. § 410(c)">17 U.S.C. § 410(c)</ref>.</item>
            <item>The copyright owner may be entitled to claim statutory damages and attorney’s fees in an infringement lawsuit, provided that the work was registered before the infringement began or within three months after the first publication of the work. See <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="412" cite="17 U.S.C. §§ 412">17 U.S.C. §§ 412</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="504" subsection="c" cite="504(c)">504(c)</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="505" cite="505">505</ref>.</item>
            <item>Many of the exceptions and limitations set forth in Sections 107 through 122 of the Copyright Act may be impacted depending on whether the work is published or unpublished. See, e.g., <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="107" cite="17 U.S.C. §§ 107">17 U.S.C. §§ 107</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="108" cite="108">108</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="115" cite="115">115</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="118" cite="118">118</ref>, and <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="121" cite="121">121</ref>.</item>
            <item>As a general rule, U.S. works first published in the United States before March 1, 1989 must be published with a valid copyright notice. Failing to include a valid notice on a U.S. work published during this period may invalidate the copyright in that work. For a detailed discussion of these notice requirements, see Chapter 2200, Sections 2203 through 2207.</item>

    <section label="1904" id="sec-1904">
        <section_title><num>1904</num> General Policies Concerning Publication</section_title>
        <paragraph>This Section discusses the U.S. Copyright Office’s general practices and procedures for examining published and unpublished works.</paragraph>
        
        <subsection label="1904.1" id="subsec-1904-1">
            <subsection_title><num>1904.1</num> Applicant Makes the Determination</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>The applicant—not the U.S. Copyright Office—must determine whether a work is published or unpublished.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Act is the exclusive source of copyright protection in the United States, and all applicants—both foreign and domestic—must demonstrate that a work satisfies the requirements of U.S. copyright law to register a work with the Office.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Determining whether a work is published or unpublished should be based on U.S. copyright law under Title 17, and it should be based on the facts that exist at the time the application is filed with the Office, even if the work was created in a foreign country, first published in a foreign country, or created by a citizen, domiciliary, or habitual resident of a foreign country.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Upon request, the Office will provide the applicant with general information about the provisions of the Copyright Act, including the statutory definition of publication, and will explain the relevant practices and procedures for registering a published or unpublished work with the Office. The Office will not give specific legal advice on whether a particular work has or has not been published. However, if an assertion is clearly contrary to facts known by the Office, a claim may be questioned, or in certain situations, refused.</paragraph>
        </subsection>

        <subsection label="1904.2" id="subsec-1904-2">
            <subsection_title><num>1904.2</num> Facts Stated in the Application</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>As a general rule, the U.S. Copyright Office will not conduct its own factual investigation to determine whether a work is published or unpublished or to confirm the truth of the statements made in the application concerning publication.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Ordinarily, the Office will accept the facts stated in the application, unless they are implausible or conflict with information provided elsewhere in the registration materials, the Office’s records, or other sources of information that are known by the Office.</paragraph>
        </subsection>

        <subsection label="1904.3" id="subsec-1904-3">
            <subsection_title><num>1904.3</num> Claim in a Published or Unpublished Work Contradicted by Information Provided Elsewhere, such as in the Registration Materials</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>As a general rule, if the applicant affirmatively states that the work is unpublished or fails to provide a date of first publication in the application, the Office will register the work as an unpublished work, unless the information provided in the deposit copy or in other sources of information known by the Office clearly indicate that the work has been published.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Likewise, if the applicant affirmatively states that the work has been published and provides a date of first publication in the application, the Office generally will register the work as a published work, unless information provided in the deposit copies or in other sources of information known by the Office clearly suggest that the work is unpublished.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If the deposit copy(ies) or other information known by the Office clearly suggest that the work is published or unpublished and if it appears that the applicant provided or failed to provide a date of publication by mistake, the registration specialist may communicate with the applicant. For examples of situations that may prompt a communication concerning publication, see Chapter 600, Sections 612.7(A) and 612.7(B).</paragraph>

    <section label="1905" id="sec-1905">
        <section_title><num>1905</num> Distribution of Copies or Phonorecords of a Work</section_title>
        <paragraph>As discussed in Section 1902, publication occurs when one or more copies or phonorecords of a work are distributed to the public by or with the authority of the copyright owner. These issues are discussed in Sections 1905.1 through 1905.3 below.</paragraph>

        <subsection label="1905.1" id="subsec-1905-1">
            <subsection_title><num>1905.1</num> Distribution to the Public</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>Section 101 of the Copyright Act states a work is published when copies or phonorecords of that work are distributed “to the public.” <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="101" cite="17 U.S.C. § 101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref>. Specifically, publication occurs when one or more copies or phonorecords are distributed to a member of the public who is not subject to any express or implied restrictions concerning the disclosure of the content of that work. If a work exists only in one copy – such as a painting embodied solely in a canvas – the work may be considered published if that copy is distributed to the public with the authorization of the copyright owner. <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="61, 138" year="1976" cite="H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 61, 138 (1976)">H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 61, 138 (1976)</ref>, reprinted in <ref source="USCCAN" year="1976" page="5754, 5675" cite="1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5754, 5675">1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5754, 5675</ref> (stating that “[t]he reference to ‘copies and phonorecords,’ although in the plural, are intended . . . to include the singular.”).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Examples:</paragraph>
            <list>
                <item>Selling copies of a textbook to a local school board constitutes publication of that work.</item>
                <item>Selling a product with copyrightable artwork on the packaging and label constitutes publication of that artwork.</item>
                <item>Mailing copies of a catalog to potential customers constitutes publication of that catalog and any unpublished works revealed in that work.</item>
                <item>Distributing copies of a leaflet on a street corner constitutes publication of that work.</item>
                <item>Transmitting a copy of an illustration to a client constitutes publication of that work, if the copyright owner authorized the client to use that image and did not impose any restrictions on the client’s ability to disclose that work to the public.</item>
                <item>Giving away copies of a photograph without further restriction constitutes publication of that work.</item>
                <item>Lending, renting, or leasing copies of a work constitutes publication of that work.</item>
                <item>Distributing copies of a motion picture through a retail service constitutes publication of that work.</item>
                <item>Selling the original copy of a painting at an auction.</item>
            </list>
            <paragraph>If an actual distribution has not occurred, the work is considered unpublished. Likewise, a work is considered unpublished if the copies or phonorecords were not distributed to a member of the public, but instead were much more restricted, including an exchange between family members or social acquaintances.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The courts created the doctrine of “limited publication” to distinguish certain distributions from a “general publication” and to avoid the divestive consequences of publication without notice when it was clear the author (or copyright proprietor) restricted both the purpose and the recipients of the distribution. Generally, a limited publication is the distribution of copies of a work to a definitely selected group with a limited purpose and without the right of diffusion, reproduction, distribution, or sale. A limited publication is not considered a distribution to the public and, therefore, is not publication. See <ref source="CASE" case_name="White v. Kimmell" volume="193" reporter="F.2d" page="744" court_year="9th Cir. 1952" cite="White v. Kimmell, 193 F.2d 744, 746-47 (9th Cir. 1952)">White v. Kimmell, 193 F.2d 744, 746-47 (9th Cir. 1952)</ref> (explaining that a publication is limited if it “communicates the contents of a [work] to a definitely selected group and for a limited purpose, and without the right of diffusion, reproduction, distribution or sale … [and is] restricted both as to persons and purpose.”).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Examples:</paragraph>
            <list>
                <item>Sending copies of a manuscript to prospective publishers in an effort to secure a book contract does not constitute publication (regardless of whether the copies are returned).</item>
                <item>Distributing copies of a research paper that are intended solely for the use of the participants at a seminar generally does not constitute publication if there was no right of further diffusion, reproduction, distribution, or sale by the participants.</item>
                <item>Distributing copies of a speech that are intended solely to assist the press in covering that event has been deemed a limited publication under the Copyright Act of 1909 (i.e., not a publication). However, under the current statutory definition, offering to distribute copies to different news outlets for the purpose of further distribution, public performance, or public display could constitute publication.</item>
            </list>
            <paragraph>Moreover, a work may be considered unpublished if, in addition to communicating a work to a definitely selected group and for a limited purpose, the copyright owner imposed any express or implied restrictions concerning the disclosure of the content of that work, such as placing a statement on the copies or phonorecords indicating that distribution of the work is limited or restricted in some way, such as “Confidential—these specifications are for internal office use only.”</paragraph>
        </subsection>

        <subsection label="1905.2" id="subsec-1905-2">
            <subsection_title><num>1905.2</num> The Means of Distribution</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>As discussed in Section 1902, publication occurs when copies or phonorecords are distributed to the public by means of a sale or other transfer of ownership, such as giving copies away. Likewise, publication occurs when copies or phonorecords are distributed by means of rental, lease, or lending (i.e., where the copies or phonorecords change hands, but there is no change in the ownership of those copies or phonorecords).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Distributing copies or phonorecords by any other means does not constitute publication. In particular, the legislative history states that “any form or dissemination in which a material object does not change hands... is not a publication no matter how many people are exposed to the work.” <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="138" year="1976" cite="H.R.

            <paragraph>Section 101 of the Copyright Act states that “offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution, public performance, or public display constitutes publication.” <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="101" cite="17 U.S.C. § 101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref>. Specifically, publication occurs when one or more copies or phonorecords are offered to wholesalers, retailers, broadcasters, aggregators, or similar intermediaries for the purpose of distributing the work to the public or for the purpose of publicly performing or publicly displaying the work. If a work exists only in one copy, the work may be considered published if that copy is offered to a group of persons with the authorization of the copyright owner. <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="61, 138" year="1976" cite="H.R.

            <paragraph>Offering a work directly to the public constitutes publication where the offeror has completed all the steps necessary for distribution to the public, such that the only further action required is an offeree’s action in obtaining a copy or phonorecord. By contrast, offering a work directly to the public does not constitute publication where distribution of copies or phonorecords requires additional action by the offeror.</paragraph>

                <item>An online advertisement that offers to sell an ebook to the public, but does not make the ebook available for download, does not constitute publication of that ebook.</item>
                <item>An offer by the copyright owner on a public website to purchase and download an app that they developed and made accessible on that website constitutes publication of that app.</item>

        <paragraph>The statute states that a work is published when copies or phonorecords are distributed to the public.

        <paragraph>As discussed in Section 1902, a public performance or a public display of a work “does not of itself constitute publication.” <ref source="USC" title="United States Code" volume="17" section="101" cite="17 U.S.C. § 101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref> (definition of “publication”).

            <paragraph>The legislative history explains that a performance or display constitutes a public performance or a public display if it occurs “in a public place.” It also explains that a performance or display that occurs in a “semipublic” place, such as a club, lodge, factory, summer camp, or school, is considered a public performance or display. <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="64" year="1976" cite="H.R.

            <paragraph>A performance or display that is transmitted to the public is considered a public performance or a public display “even though the recipients are not gathered in a single place, and even if there is no proof that any of the potential recipients was operating his receiving apparatus at the time of the transmission.” Id. at 64-65, reprinted in <ref source="USCCAN" year="1976" page="5678" cite="1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5678">1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5678</ref>. “In other words, ‘the public’ need not be situated together, spatially or temporally” for a public performance or public display to occur. <ref source="CASE" case_name="American Broadcasting Companies" volume="134" reporter="S.

            <paragraph>Moreover, “when an entity communicates the same contemporaneously perceptible images and sounds to multiple people, it transmits a performance to them regardless of the number of discrete communications it makes.” Id. at 2509.
