            <subsection_title><num>101.1</num> History of the U.S. Copyright Office</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>In May 1790, when Congress enacted the first federal copyright law, the U.S. Copyright Office did not yet exist. Instead, authors and publishers recorded their claims with federal district courts and submitted copies of their works (in those days, book, maps, and charts) in support of their applications. These works, known as deposits, were stored in a variety of places, including in the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of the Interior. As of 1846, the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress shared them. This meant that records of copyright ownership were scattered among different government offices, and despite the federal scheme of protection, there was neither a consolidated tracking system nor centralized plan for preserving or using deposited works.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In 1870, Congress moved registration and deposit functions from the dispersed federal courts to the Library of Congress, which under Ainsworth Spofford advocated for and utilized the deposit copies as a foundation for the Library’s collection. This move helped transform the Library of Congress into a national institution. However, as copyright law evolved in both scope and complexity, the Nation and the Congress began grappling with a variety of policy issues that required leadership and expertise, including, for example, provisions that extended the public performance right to musical compositions and provided corresponding criminal penalties and injunctive relief, and amendments establishing reciprocity with foreign governments. Moreover, the volume of copyright-related work required greater focus and segregation from general Library functions. See <ref source="CONGR_HEARING" cite="Condition of the Library of Congress: Hearings Before the Joint Committee on the Library, 54th Cong. (1897)">Condition of the Library of Congress: Hearings Before the Joint Committee on the Library, 54th Cong. (1897)</ref> (statement of Ainsworth Spofford) (“The fruit of [the Copyright Act] has been to enormously enrich the Library of Congress. On the other hand, it has at the same time enormously increased the difficulties of administration in such miserably narrow quarters.”), reprinted in <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="S" number="54-1573" page="28" year="1897" cite="S. REP. NO. 54-1573, at 28 (1897)">S. REP. NO. 54-1573, at 28 (1897)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>In 1897, Congress established and funded the U.S. Copyright Office as a separate department within the Library and created the position of Register of Copyrights to head it. Since that act, the Register has been appointed by, and works under the general direction of, the Librarian of Congress. This appointment authority, however, required that the Librarian thereafter be appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate. Thus, at the dawn of the twentieth century, Congress had not only created a formal foundation for copyright administration, but also created the Register as the central position of related expertise within the U.S. government, who in turn developed an expert staff.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>As with other matters of intellectual property law, Congressional Rules give the respective judiciary committees of both chambers legislative jurisdiction over all copyright matters. See <ref source="RULE" body="Senate" number="XXV" cite="Senate Rule XXV">Senate Rule XXV</ref>; <ref source="RULE" body="House" number="X" cite="House Rule X">House Rule X</ref>. The Register is the principal advisor to Congress regarding domestic and international copyright issues, but also works closely and collaboratively with other federal departments and agencies on copyright matters.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The longstanding role of the U.S. Copyright Office in policy matters was codified in the Copyright Act. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="701" cite="17 U.S.C. § 701">17 U.S.C. § 701</ref>. The work of the Office takes several forms. It provides expert subject matter assistance to Congress on copyright policy and interpretation of the copyright law; provides drafting support, including analysis and assistance for copyright legislation and legislative reports; undertakes studies and public roundtables for Congress; and offers advice on compliance with treaties and trade agreements.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>As a critical office within the U.S. government, the U.S. Copyright Office also works closely with executive branch offices, including most regularly the Department of Justice, the White House, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of Commerce and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and the Department of State. It provides policy analysis to these offices; participates in copyright-related litigation; provides support on trade and enforcement measures; participates on U.S. delegations to intergovernmental meetings and in other international events; hosts copyright training for copyright officials from foreign countries; and provides outreach and education on a routine basis.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Register of Copyrights has an especially important relationship with the Undersecretary for Intellectual Property, who heads the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and advises the President on intellectual property matters. These officers frequently work together in the international arena and the Undersecretary must consult with the Register “on all copyright and related matters” that involve his Office. <ref source="USC" title="35" section="2(c)(5)" cite="35 U.S.C. § 2(c)(5)">35 U.S.C. § 2(c)(5)</ref>. The U.S. Copyright Office also works closely with the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (the “IPEC”), based in the Executive Office of the President. The Register is a statutory member of the IPEC’s interagency intellectual property enforcement advisory committee. <ref source="USC" title="15" section="8111(b)(3)(A)(ii)" cite="15 U.S.C. § 8111(b)(3)(A)(ii)">15 U.S.C. § 8111(b)(3)(A)(ii)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Finally, the U.S. Copyright Office’s unique position as the guardian of copyright registration documents deserves special mention. The Office maintains a wealth of information about the different types of works that have been registered in the United States throughout the years. This amounts to an unparalleled database of cultural heritage, as the Office has registered millions of copyright claims for authors, artists, publishers, producers, and distributors of creative works since 1897. The Office annually registers more than half a million copyright claims, records more than 10,000 documents relating to chain of title and other copyright-related matters in connection with hundreds of thousands of titles, and collects more than $300 million dollars in statutory licensing funds. Likewise, it has facilitated the acquisition of hundreds of thousands of copies of books, serial publications, sound recordings, motion pictures, photographs, maps, and prints for the Library’s collection.</paragraph>
             <paragraph>U.S. Copyright Office records also provide a glimpse into the evolution of U.S. registration and recordation practices. Examples of some important historic registrations and recordations include:</paragraph>
             <list>
                <item>First federal registration of a work: John Barry’s book, The Philadelphia Spelling Book, registered with the U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania in 1790.</item>
                <item>First federal recordation of a document pertaining to copyright: Issued on July 25, 1870.</item>
                <item>Registration of the Statue of Liberty: On August 31, 1876, Henry de Stuckle and Auguste F. Bartholdi secured registration number 9939-G for the “Statue of American Independence,” as the Statue of Liberty was first named. The copyright claim was filed in America’s centennial year, a decade before the statue was erected in New York Harbor.</item>
                <item>First registration issued after the establishment of the U.S. Copyright Office: “Dr. Quixote – A New Comedy in Three Acts” by Charles F. Coughlan, registered by J.E. Dodson on July 1, 1897.</item>
                <item>First motion picture registrations: The Edison Kinetoscopic Record of a Sneeze, January 7, 1894, submitted on January 9, 1894 by William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, is the earliest extant copyrighted motion picture in the Library of Congress’s collections. The short clip, known in film circles as Fred Ott’s Sneeze, shows a mustachioed man sneezing. The motion picture was registered as a series of photographs because motion pictures were not covered by U.S. copyright law until 1912. The first work registered as a motion picture was the Republic Film Company’s September 12, 1912 registration for Black Sheep’s Wool.</item>
                <item>First television show registration: “Unexpected Guest” by Hopalong Cassidy, registered in 1947.</item>
                <item>First registration for a choreographic work embodied in Laban notation: Hanya Holm’s choreography for Kiss Me Kate, registered as a dramatic work in 1952.</item>
                <item>First computer program registration: John F. Banzhaf’s computer program to compute automobile braking distances, registered in 1964.</item>
                <item>First sound recording registration: Bob and Dorothy Roberts’s “Color Photo Processing Cassette, An Accurate Sound Signal and Oral Instruction System for Processing,” registered on February 15, 1972.</item>

                    <item>Registration: The U.S. Copyright Office examines applications for registering claims to copyright and any accompanying deposit copy(ies) to determine whether they satisfy the statutory requirements for registrability, including copyrightability, and otherwise comply with the Office’s regulations. Based on its findings, the Office then either registers or refuses to register the claims. Many of the controlling provisions for registration are set forth in <ref source="USC" title="17" chapter="4" cite="Chapter 4 of the Copyright Act">Chapter 4 of the Copyright Act</ref>. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408" cite="Section 408 of the Act">Section 408 of the Act</ref> authorizes the Register to promulgate regulations to allow identifying material in place of deposit copy(ies), permit the registration of groups of related works with one application, and provide for the correction and amplification of registrations. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="410" cite="Section 410 of the Act">Section 410 of the Act</ref> sets forth the Register’s authority to examine and either register or refuse copyright claims. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="411" cite="Sections 411">Sections 411</ref> and <ref source="USC" title="17" section="412" cite="412">412</ref> address registration as a prerequisite for civil infringement claims and certain remedies. Chapters 200 through 2200 of this Compendium discuss the Office’s policies and practices relating to the examination of claims for copyright registration.</item>
                    <item>Recordation: The statutory provisions governing recordation are set forth in <ref source="USC" title="17" chapter="2" cite="Chapter 2 of the Copyright Act">Chapter 2 of the Copyright Act</ref>. Under <ref source="USC" title="17" section="205" cite="Section 205">Section 205</ref>, any transfer of copyright ownership or other document relating to copyright may be recorded in the U.S. Copyright Office, subject to certain conditions. The recordation of documents pertaining to transfers or other ownership matters is voluntary, but recommended because: (i) it provides constructive notice of the facts stated in the recorded document if certain conditions have been met; (ii) when a transfer of copyright is timely recorded (within one month of its execution in the United States or two months of its execution outside of the United States, or any time before a conflicting transfer is recorded), the recorded transfer prevails over a later executed transfer; and (iii) a complete public record may mitigate problems related to orphan works. Interested parties also record or consult documents pertaining to licenses, death of authors, expiration of term, wills, trusts, security interests, and mortgages, to name a few. For a discussion of some of these documents, see Chapter 2300 of this Compendium.</item>
                    <item>Termination notices: The Copyright Act allows, under certain circumstances, authors or their heirs to terminate an agreement that previously granted one or more of the author’s exclusive rights to a third party. These termination provisions are set forth in <ref source="USC" title="17" section="203" cite="Sections 203">Sections 203</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="17" section="304(c)" cite="304(c)">304(c)</ref>, and <ref source="USC" title="17" section="304(d)" cite="304(d)">304(d)</ref> of the Act. To terminate an agreement, a notice of termination must be served on the grantee, and it must be recorded with the U.S. Copyright Office in a timely manner as a condition of effect. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="203(a)(4)" cite="17 U.S.C. §§ 203(a)(4)">17 U.S.C. §§ 203(a)(4)</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="17" section="304(c)(4)" cite="304(c)(4)">304(c)(4)</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="17" section="304(d)(1)" cite="304(d)(1)">304(d)(1)</ref>. For a discussion of recordation of notices of termination, see Chapter 2300, Section 2310 of this Compendium.</item>
                    <item>Public records: The U.S. Copyright Office maintains extensive public records of copyright claims dating back to 1870 and in some instances earlier, including:
                        <list>
                           <item>Certificates of registration, which attest that registration has been made and may constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate (if registration is made before publication or within five years of first publication). <ref source="USC" title="17" section="410(c)" cite="17 U.S.C. § 410(c)">17 U.S.C. § 410(c)</ref>.</item>
                            <item>The online public record, which provides the basic facts of registrations and recordations made after January 1, 1978. This information is available in a searchable database on the Office’s website.</item>
                            <item>The Copyright Card Catalog, which is a physical archive available for public use at the Copyright Office in searching for completed registrations and recorded documents made before January 1, 1978.</item>
                         </list>
                    In some circumstances, the Office will issue certified copies of applications, correspondence, deposit copy(ies), documents, and other materials submitted to the Office in connection with copyright registrations and recorded documents. In addition, the Office has a reference search service that provides search reports regarding the facts of registration and recordation contained in the Office’s files. For a discussion of these services, see Chapter 2400 of this Compendium.</item>
                    <item>Mandatory deposit: The U.S. Copyright Office administers <ref source="USC" title="17" section="407" cite="Section 407 of the Copyright Act">Section 407 of the Copyright Act</ref>, which requires copyright owners to deposit certain published works with the Library of Congress for its collections. In this role, the Office may facilitate, demand, negotiate, or exempt the provision of copies or phonorecords. Absent a special exemption, the law requires that one or two copies of the best edition of every copyrightable work published in the United States be sent to the Office within three months of publication, regardless of whether a claim in the work is registered. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="407(a)" cite="17 U.S.C. § 407(a)">17 U.S.C. § 407(a)</ref>.

        <paragraph>U.S. copyright law is derived from several authoritative sources, including the U.S. Constitution, statutory provisions, court decisions, and regulations.

            <paragraph>Copyright has been a part of the American legal landscape since colonial times, when many of the colonies adopted copyright laws. See <ref source="OTHER" type="Copyright Office Bulletin" number="3" pages="9-29" cite="U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE BULLETIN 3, COPYRIGHT ENACTMENTS 1783-1900, at 9-29">U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE BULLETIN 3, COPYRIGHT ENACTMENTS 1783-1900, at 9-29</ref> (listing copyright laws enacted by Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and New York between 1783 and 1786), available at www.copyright.gov/history/Copyright_Enactments_1783-1973.pdf. Upon ratification, the U.S. Constitution provided Congress with the ability to make federal laws to protect copyright. Specifically, <ref source="CONST" article="1" section="8" clause="8" cite="Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8">Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8</ref> (which includes the “Copyright Clause”) states that “Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” The promotion of “science,” as that term is used in the Copyright Clause, is understood to refer to the purpose of copyright law (despite the contemporary usage of the term). See <ref source="CASE" case_name="Eldred v. Ashcroft" volume="537" reporter="U.S." page="186" court_year="2003" cite="Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186, 197 (2003)">Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186, 197 (2003)</ref>. The Supreme Court has confirmed that this clause empowers Congress to enact a copyright system. See <ref source="CASE" case_name="Golan v. Holder" volume="565" reporter="U.S." page="302" court_year="2012" cite="Golan v. Holder, 565 U.S. 302, 323-25 (2012)">Golan v. Holder, 565 U.S. 302, 323-25 (2012)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>U.S. courts have analyzed the purpose of the Copyright Clause in a number of cases. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Copyright Clause to mean that copyright laws should promote both the creation and dissemination of creative works. See, e.g., <ref source="CASE" case_name="Golan" volume="132" reporter="S. Ct." page="888-89" cite="Golan, 132 S. Ct. at 888-89">Golan, 132 S. Ct. at 888-89</ref>.

            <paragraph>Congress has exercised its authority to enact federal copyright laws on numerous occasions. The first Copyright Act, enacted in 1790, and subsequent laws are summarized in the historical timeline in Section 102.7 below. The current Copyright Act was enacted in 1976 and became effective on January 1, 1978. It has been amended numerous times since its enactment. The Copyright Act protects “original works of authorship” that are “fixed in any tangible medium of expression….” <ref source="USC" title="17" section="102(a)" cite="17 U.S.C. § 102(a)">17 U.S.C. § 102(a)</ref>. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="106" cite="Section 106 of the Act">Section 106 of the Act</ref> provides copyright holders with a number of exclusive rights (including the right to reproduce works, prepare derivative works, distribute works, and in certain cases, to publicly perform and display works). It also provides certain exceptions and limitations to these exclusive rights. See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="107-122" cite="17 U.S.C. §§ 107-122">17 U.S.C. §§ 107-122</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Works that predate the effective date of the 1976 Act are governed by statutory provisions of the 1909 Copyright Act; the most relevant of these provisions are discussed in Chapter 2100 of this Compendium.</paragraph>

                <provision_title><num>102.2(A)</num> Copyright Act of 1976</provision_title>
                <paragraph>The 1976 Act replaced the 1909 Copyright Act and changed much of how copyright law operates, including as follows:</paragraph>
                <list>
                    <item>The 1976 Act implemented a new calculus for determining the duration of copyright (known as the “term of protection” or, more simply, the “term”). Previously, works were protected for a specific initial term and could be renewed for an additional renewal term. The 1976 Act does not require renewal. In most cases, the Act provides protection to works based on the time frame of the author’s life plus seventy years. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="302(a)" cite="17 U.S.C. § 302(a)">17 U.S.C. § 302(a)</ref>. In the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made for hire, the copyright lasts for a term of ninety-five years from the year of its first publication, or a term of one hundred twenty years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="302(c)" cite="17 U.S.C. § 302(c)">17 U.S.C. § 302(c)</ref>.</item>
                    <item>Unlike prior U.S. copyright laws, copyright protection under the 1976 Act is not contingent on publication or registration. All copyrightable works are now protected from the moment of fixation in a tangible medium of expression, regardless of whether they are published, registered, or recorded at any time. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="102(a)" cite="17 U.S.C. § 102(a)">17 U.S.C. § 102(a)</ref>.</item>
                    <item>The 1976 Act (in <ref source="USC" title="17" section="203" cite="Sections 203">Sections 203</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="17" section="304(c)" cite="304(c)">304(c)</ref>, and <ref source="USC" title="17" section="304(d)" cite="304(d)">304(d)</ref>) allows an author to terminate certain grants of copyright in the author’s work after a specified number of years. The 1909 Act, by contrast, gave the author an opportunity to recoup his or her rights by vesting the copyright in the renewal term in the author, meaning that the author had to provide a separate grant expressly to a publisher or other third party for the renewal term (i.e., after the first twenty-eight years).</item>
                    <item>The 1976 Act added protections for certain additional types of works, including pantomime and choreography. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="102(a)(4)" cite="17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(4)">17 U.S.C. § 102(a)(4)</ref>. Since 1976, the statute has been amended to provide copyright protection for architectural works and certain protection for mask works and vessel designs.</item>
                    <item>Congress added numerous exceptions and limitations to the statute (currently set forth in <ref source="USC" title="17" section="107-122" cite="Sections 107 through 122 of the Act">Sections 107 through 122 of the Act</ref>), including <ref source="USC" title="17" section="107" cite="Sections 107">Sections 107</ref> (which codified the judicially-created fair use doctrine) and <ref source="USC" title="17" section="108" cite="108">108</ref> (which created specific exceptions for libraries and archives).</item>
                </list>
                 <paragraph>Congress has updated the 1976 Act several times. For more information concerning these amendments, see the historical timeline in Section 102.7 below.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>For example, the Copyright Act does not explain what level of creativity is necessary for a work to qualify as a “work of authorship” under the Act. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="102(a)" cite="Section 102(a) of the Act">Section 102(a) of the Act</ref> states — without further elaboration — that “[c]opyright protection subsists… in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.” Numerous courts have analyzed what an original work of authorship is under the Act. For more information on the originality requirement, see Chapter 300, Section 308 of this Compendium.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The standards for comparing works and determining when a work protected by copyright is infringed by another work also come from judicial doctrine. For instance, courts have held that, to prevail in a copyright infringement case, a copyright owner must show (i) direct evidence that the defendant copied the copyright owner’s work, or (ii) that the defendant had access to the copyrighted work, and (iii) that the copyright owner’s and defendant’s works are substantially similar.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Certain U.S. copyright law doctrines are entirely judicially-created and have never been directly codified in the Act, such as theories of contributory and vicarious liability for infringement. Others, such as principles of fair use (<ref source="USC" title="17" section="107" cite="Section 107 of the Act">Section 107 of the Act</ref>), are codified at a high level in the 1976 Act, but are interpreted on a case-by-case basis by the courts.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For these reasons, it is important to consult court opinions on copyright-related issues. When doing so, note that copyright law doctrines may differ among jurisdictions, as different circuits have followed different standards. For example, the infringement standard in the Ninth Circuit is somewhat different from that of the First and the Second Circuits.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>102.5</num> State Laws</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>U.S. copyright protection is governed by federal law. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="301(a)" cite="Section 301(a) of the 1976 Act">Section 301(a) of the 1976 Act</ref> preempts all similar protections provided by state law, other than with respect to sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, as provided under <ref source="USC" title="17" section="301(c)" cite="Section 301(c) of the Act">Section 301(c) of the Act</ref>. Preemption applies only when a state law provides protections that are equivalent to those set forth in the Copyright Act (i.e., rights equivalent to any of the exclusive rights under <ref source="USC" title="17" section="106" cite="Section 106 of the Act">Section 106 of the Act</ref> in fixed works of authorship that fall within the subject matter of copyright). There are a significant number of court decisions interpreting exactly when a state claim is close enough to an exclusive right provided by the Copyright Act to be preempted. This case law should be consulted for questions regarding preemption and may vary to some extent by jurisdiction.</paragraph>
            <paragraph><ref source="USC" title="17" section="301(b)" cite="Sections 301(b)">Sections 301(b)</ref> and <ref source="USC" title="17" section="301(c)" cite="301(c)">301(c)</ref> of the 1976 Act also specifically set forth some types of copyright-like protections that states may provide. These include: (i) works not fixed in a tangible medium of expression; (ii) a narrow exception for nonsubscription broadcast transmission of pre-1972 sound recordings; (iii) state and local landmarks, historic preservation, zoning, or building codes relating to architectural works protected under <ref source="USC" title="17" section="102(a)(8)" cite="Section 102(a)(8) of the Act">Section 102(a)(8) of the Act</ref>; and (iv) causes of actions for acts that took place before January 1, 1978.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>102.6</num> Territorial Scope of U.S. Copyright Law</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>Generally speaking, U.S. copyright law applies only to acts that take place in the United States, including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and U.S. territories. See <ref source="CASE" case_name="Subafilms, Ltd. v. MGM-Pathe Communications Co." volume="24" reporter="F.3d" page="1088" court_year="1994" cite="Subafilms, Ltd. v. MGM-Pathe Communications Co., 24 F.3d 1088, 1094-95 (9th Cir. 1994)">Subafilms, Ltd. v. MGM-Pathe Communications Co., 24 F.3d 1088, 1094-95 (9th Cir. 1994)</ref>. Under the Berne Convention, national law applies to foreign works, and the law of the country in which infringement takes place generally applies to infringement disputes. <ref source="TREATY" name="Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works" article="5(1), (3)" date="Sept. 9, 1886" number="S. Treaty Doc. No. 99-27" year="1986" cite="Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, art. 5(1), (3), Sept. 9, 1886, as revised at Paris on July 24, 1971 and amended on Sept. 28, 1979, S.

Treaty Doc. No. 99-27 (1986)</ref>. Thus, copyright infringement that occurs in the United States is governed by U.S. law. However, courts may look to the law of a foreign country where ownership of the work was established or transferred in cases where questions are raised concerning foreign ownership and copyright origin even in the context of a U.S. infringement action.
