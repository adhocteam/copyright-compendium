      History of the U.S. Copyright Office
     </subsection_title>
     <paragraph>
      In May 1790, when Congress enacted the first federal copyright law, the U.S. Copyright Office did not yet exist. Instead, authors and publishers recorded their claims with federal district courts and submitted
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copies">
       copies
      </a>
      of their works (in those days, book, maps, and charts) in support of their applications. These works, known as
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#deposit">
       deposits
      </a>
      , were stored in a variety of places, including in the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of the Interior. As of 1846, the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress shared them. This meant that records of copyright ownership were scattered among different government offices, and despite the federal scheme of protection, there was neither a consolidated tracking system nor centralized plan for preserving or using deposited works.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In 1870, Congress moved
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#registration">

      </a>
      and
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#deposit">
       deposit
      </a>
      functions from the dispersed federal courts to the Library of Congress, which under Ainsworth Spofford advocated for and utilized the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#deposit_copies">
       deposit copies
      </a>
      as a foundation for the Library’s collection. This move helped transform the Library of Congress into a national institution. However, as copyright law evolved in both scope and complexity, the Nation and the Congress began grappling with a variety of policy issues that required leadership and expertise, including, for example, provisions that extended the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#public_performance">
       public performance
      </a>
      right to musical compositions and provided corresponding criminal penalties and injunctive relief, and amendments establishing reciprocity with foreign governments. Moreover, the volume of copyright-related work required greater focus and segregation from general Library functions. See

       Condition of the Library of Congress: Hearings Before the Joint Committee on the Library, 54th Cong. (1897) (statement of Ainsworth Spofford)
      </ref>
      ("The fruit of [the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyright_act">
       Copyright Act
      </a>
      ] has been to enormously enrich the Library of Congress. On the other hand, it has at the same time enormously increased the difficulties of administration in such miserably narrow quarters.”), reprinted in

       S. REP. NO. 54-1573, at 28 (1897)
      </ref>
      .
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      In 1897, Congress established and funded the U.S. Copyright Office as a separate department within the Library and created the position of
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#register_of_copyrights">
       Register of Copyrights
      </a>
      to head it. Since that

      , the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#register_of_copyrights">
       Register
      </a>
      has been appointed by, and works under the general direction of, the Librarian of Congress. This appointment authority, however, required that the Librarian thereafter be appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate. Thus, at the dawn of the twentieth century, Congress had not only created a formal foundation for copyright administration, but also created the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#register_of_copyrights">
       Register
      </a>
      as the central position of related expertise within the U.S. government, who in turn developed an expert staff.

     As with other matters of intellectual property law, Congressional Rules give the respective judiciary committees of both chambers legislative jurisdiction over all copyright matters. See

     is the principal advisor to Congress regarding domestic and international copyright issues, but also works closely and collaboratively with other federal departments and agencies on copyright matters.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     The longstanding role of the U.S. Copyright Office in policy matters was codified in the
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyright_act">
      Copyright Act
     </a>
     .
     <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title17-section701&amp;edition=prelim">
      17 U.S.C. § 701
     </a>
     . The work of the Office takes several forms. It provides expert subject matter assistance to Congress on copyright policy and interpretation of the copyright law; provides drafting support, including analysis and assistance for copyright legislation and legislative reports; undertakes studies and public roundtables for Congress; and offers advice on compliance with treaties and trade agreements.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     As a critical office within the U.S. government, the U.S. Copyright Office also works closely with executive branch offices, including most regularly the Department of Justice, the White House, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of Commerce and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and the Department of State. It provides policy analysis to these offices; participates in copyright-related litigation; provides support on trade and enforcement measures; participates on U.S. delegations to intergovernmental meetings and in other international events; hosts copyright training for copyright officials from foreign countries; and provides outreach and education on a routine basis.

     The
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#register_of_copyrights">
      Register of Copyrights
     </a>
     has an especially important relationship with the Undersecretary for Intellectual Property, who heads the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and advises the President on intellectual property matters. These officers frequently work together in the international arena and the Undersecretary must consult with the
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#register_of_copyrights">

     "on all copyright and related matters” that involve his Office.

      35 U.S.C. § 2(c)(5)
     </a>
     . The U.S. Copyright Office also works closely with the Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator (the "IPEC"), based in the Executive Office of the President. The
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#register_of_copyrights">

     Finally, the U.S. Copyright Office's unique position as the guardian of copyright
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#registration">

     </a>
     documents deserves special mention. The Office maintains a wealth of information about the different types of works that have been registered in the United States throughout the years. This amounts to an unparalleled

     </a>
     of cultural heritage, as the Office has registered millions of copyright claims for authors, artists, publishers, producers, and distributors of creative works since 1897. The Office annually registers more than half a million copyright claims, records more than 10,000 documents relating to chain of title and other copyright-related matters in connection with hundreds of thousands of titles, and collects more than $300 million dollars in

      Constitutional Basis for and Purpose of Copyright Law

     <paragraph>
      Copyright has been a part of the American legal landscape since colonial times, when many of the colonies adopted copyright laws. See
      <ref id="Bulletin_3_Copyright_Enactments" source="USCO_Bulletin">
       U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE BULLETIN 3, COPYRIGHT ENACTMENTS 1783-1900, at 9-29
      </ref>
      (listing copyright laws enacted by Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and New York between 1783 and 1786), available at
      <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/history/Copyright_Enactments_1783-1973.pdf">
       www.copyright.gov/history/Copyright_Enactments_1783-1973.pdf
      </a>
      . Upon ratification, the U.S. Constitution provided Congress with the ability to make federal laws to protect copyright. Specifically,
      <ref id="Art1_Sec8_Cl8" source="US_Constitution">
       Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8
      </ref>
      (which includes the "Copyright Clause") states that "Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” The promotion of "science,” as that term is used in the Copyright Clause, is understood to refer to the purpose of copyright law (despite the contemporary usage of the term). See
      <ref id="Eldred_v_Ashcroft_537_US_186" source="case">
       Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186, 197 (2003)
      </ref>
      . The Supreme Court has confirmed that this clause empowers Congress to enact a copyright system. See
      <ref id="Golan_v_Holder_565_US_302" source="case">
       Golan v. Holder, 565 U.S. 302, 323-25 (2012)
      </ref>
      .
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      U.S. courts have analyzed the purpose of the Copyright Clause in a number of cases. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Copyright Clause to mean that copyright laws should promote both the creation and dissemination of creative works. See, e.g.,
      <ref id="Golan_132_SCt_888" source="case">
       Golan, 132 S. Ct. at 888-89
      </ref>
      . Thus, "[t]he Framers intended copyright itself to be the engine of free expression."

      Federal Court Decisions
     </subsection_title>
     <paragraph>
      Federal courts have interpreted the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#1976_copyright_act">
       1976 Act
      </a>
      on numerous occasions, resulting in a well-developed body of case law. Sometimes courts decide issues that are not squarely addressed by the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#1976_copyright_act">
       1976 Act
      </a>
      and, in doing so, develop standards that are consistent with the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#act">
       Act
      </a>
      and provide additional guidance. Thus, certain copyright law doctrines are derived largely from court decisions.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      For example, the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyright_act">
       Copyright Act
      </a>
      does not explain what level of creativity is necessary for a work to qualify as a "work of authorship" under the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#act">
       Act
      </a>
      .
      <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title17-section102&amp;edition=prelim#USC-prelim-title17-section102-a">
       Section 102(a)
      </a>
      of the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#act">
       Act
      </a>
      states — without further elaboration — that "[c]opyright protection subsists... in original works of authorship
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#fixed">
       fixed
      </a>
      in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device." Numerous courts have analyzed what an original work of authorship is under the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#act">
       Act
      </a>
      . For more

      The standards for comparing works and determining when a work protected by copyright is
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#infringement">
       infringed
      </a>
      by another work also come from judicial doctrine. For instance, courts have held that, to prevail in a copyright
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#infringement">
       infringement
      </a>
      case, a copyright owner must show (i) direct evidence that the defendant copied the copyright owner's work, or (ii) that the defendant had access to the copyrighted work, and (iii) that the copyright owner's and defendant's works are substantially similar.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      Certain U.S. copyright law doctrines are entirely judicially-created and have never been directly codified in the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#act">
       Act
      </a>
      , such as theories of contributory and vicarious liability for
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#infringement">
       infringement
      </a>
      . Others, such as principles of fair use (
      <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title17-section107&amp;edition=prelim">
       Section 107
      </a>
      of the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#act">
       Act
      </a>
      ), are codified at a high level in the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#1976_copyright_act">
       1976 Act
      </a>
      , but are interpreted on a case-by-case basis by the courts.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      For these reasons, it is important to consult court opinions on copyright-related issues. When doing so, note that copyright law doctrines may differ among jurisdictions, as different circuits have followed different standards. For example, the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#infringement">
       infringement
      </a>
      standard in the Ninth Circuit is somewhat different from that of the First and the Second Circuits.
