    <paragraph>This Chapter provides information on the U.S. Copyright Office’s practices and procedures for preregistration.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A pregistration “allows the author of a work vulnerable to predistribution infringement to enforce her exclusive rights in court before obtaining [a] registration or refusal” from the Copyright Office. <ref source="CASE" case_name="Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com, LLC" volume="139" reporter="S. Ct." page="881" court_year="2019" cite="Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com, LLC, 139 S. Ct. 881, 889 (2019)">Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com, LLC, 139 S. Ct. 881, 889 (2019)</ref>. This procedure is primarily intended to address situations where copyrighted works are “distributed illegally via the Internet BEFORE they are even made available for sale to the public [which] severely undercuts the ability of copyright holders to receive fair and adequate compensation for their works.” <ref source="CONGR_REC" volume="151" page="S495" date="2005-01-25" cite="151 CONG. REC. S495 (daily ed. Jan. 25, 2005)">151 CONG. REC. S495 (daily ed. Jan. 25, 2005)</ref> (statement of Sen. Hatch).</paragraph>

    <section_title><num>1602</num> What Is Preregistration?</section_title>
    <paragraph>In cases involving the infringement of a United States work, copyright registration is a prerequisite for filing an infringement action and for seeking an award of statutory damages and attorney’s fees. See <ref source="USC" title="17" sections="101, 411(a), 412" cite="17 U.S.C. §§ 101, 411(a), 412">17 U.S.C. §§ 101, 411(a), 412</ref>. Often, copyright owners do not seek registration until the work has been completed and distributed to the public, which may limit the remedies that may be available in cases involving “prerelease” infringement. See <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="109-33" part="1" page="4" year="2005" cite="H.R. REP. NO. 109-33, pt. 1, at 4 (2005), reprinted in, 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 220, 223">H.R. REP. NO. 109-33, pt. 1, at 4 (2005), reprinted in, 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 220, 223</ref>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To address this concern, Congress created preregistration — a procedure that allows certain copyright owners to file an action for infringement and seek statutory damages and attorney’s fees in cases where the work was infringed before the copyright owner completed the work and released it to the public. See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408" subsection="f" paragraphs="1-2" cite="17 U.S.C. § 408(f)(1)-(2)">17 U.S.C. § 408(f)(1)-(2)</ref>; see also <ref source="FEDREG" volume="70" page="42286" date="2005-07-22" cite="Preregistration of Certain Unpublished Copyright Claims, 70 Fed.

    <section_title><num>1603</num> Eligibility Requirements</section_title>
    <paragraph>“If a copyright owner is preparing to distribute a work of a type vulnerable to predistribution infringement . . . the owner may apply for preregistration.” <ref source="CASE" case_name="Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp." volume="139" reporter="S.

    <paragraph>A work of authorship must satisfy the following criteria to qualify for this option:</paragraph>
    <list>
      <item>The work must be a motion picture; a sound recording; a musical composition; a literary work being prepared for publication in book form; a computer program; a videogame; or a photograph that is intended to advertise or market a particular product or service;</item>
      <item>The work must be copyrightable;</item>
      <item>The author must have begun to create the work;</item>
      <item>The work must be unpublished; and</item>
      <item>The work must be in the process of being prepared for commercial distribution.</item>

A work that satisfies all of these requirements is eligible for preregistration, regardless of whether it is intended to be distributed in a physical or electronic format. See <ref source="CFR" title="37" part="202" section="16" subsection="b" paragraph="3" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.16(b)(3)">37 C.F.R. § 202.16(b)(3)</ref>; see also <ref source="FEDREG" volume="70" page="42286" date="2005-07-22" cite="Preregistration of Certain Unpublished Copyright Claims, 70 Fed.

These requirements are discussed in Sections 1603.1 through 1603.5.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the work described in the application does not meet these requirements, the Office will reject the application. The Office typically receives fewer than 2,000 applications for preregistration each year (compared with more than half a million applications for registration), and the Office rejects many of these applications because the work is not eligible for this procedure.</paragraph>

    <subsection label="1603.1" id="subsec-1603-1">
      <subsection_title><num>1603.1</num> Works That Are Eligible for Preregistration</subsection_title>
      <paragraph>Congress directed the Register of Copyrights to issue preregistrations for any work of authorship that falls within a class of works that has had a history of infringement prior to the authorized commercial distribution by the copyright owner. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408" subsection="f" paragraphs="1-2" cite="17 U.S.C. § 408(f)(1)-(2)">17 U.S.C. § 408(f)(1)-(2)</ref>. The Office determined that there has been a substantial history of prerelease infringement involving the following classes of works:</paragraph>
      <list>
        <item>Motion pictures.</item>
        <item>Sound recordings.</item>
        <item>Musical compositions.</item>
        <item>Literary works being prepared for publication in book form.</item>
        <item>Computer programs (including videogames).</item>
        <item>Advertising or marketing photographs.</item>
      </list>
      <paragraph><ref source="CFR" title="37" part="202" section="16" subsection="b" paragraph="1" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.16(b)(1)">37 C.F.R. § 202.16(b)(1)</ref>. A work of authorship must fall within one or more of these classes to be eligible for preregistration. The Office will refuse an application for preregistration if the work does not appear to fall within any of these classes.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Examples:</paragraph>
      <list>
        <item>The U.S. Copyright Office will accept an application to preregister a motion picture. However, the Office will refuse to preregister a treatment, screenplay, storyboard, or shooting script for a motion picture because these types of works do not fit within the statutory definition of a “motion picture.” See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="101" cite="17 U.S.C. § 101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref> (defining motion pictures as “audiovisual works consisting of a series of related images which, when shown in succession, impart an impression of motion, together with accompanying sounds, if any”).</item>
        <item>As a general rule, a preregistration for a motion picture covers any sounds that may be embodied in that work (i.e., the soundtrack). However, the U.S. Copyright Office may question an application that asserts a claim in both a motion picture and a sound recording, because the soundtrack for a motion picture does not fit within the statutory definition of a “sound recording.” See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="101" cite="17 U.S.C. § 101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref> (defining sound recordings as “works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, but not including the sounds accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work …”).</item>
        <item>A work of fiction or nonfiction that is intended to be published in book form (i.e., hardback books, paperback books, ebooks, and the like) may be eligible for preregistration, even if the work contains material that would be ineligible for preregistration on its own, such as drawings, illustrations, or other two-dimensional artwork.</item>
        <item>A work of fiction or nonfiction that is intended to be published in book form may be eligible for preregistration, even if the work will be published exclusively online. However, the U.S. Copyright Office will not accept an application to preregister a website, because websites are not published in “book form.”</item>
        <item>A personal journal or a daily diary would be considered a literary work, but these types of works are not eligible for preregistration, because in most cases, they are not intended to be published, nor are they intended for commercial distribution. See Sections 1603.4 and 1603.5.</item>
        <item>The U.S. Copyright Office will accept an application to preregister a computer program that is intended for commercial distribution. However, the Office will refuse to preregister a claim in the HTML code for a website, because HTML code is a markup language rather than a computer programming language, and thus coding in HTML generally does not result in a computer program.</item>
        <item>A photograph that is intended to advertise or market a particular product or service may be eligible for preregistration, but a family portrait or a photograph taken on a personal vacation would not.</item>
        <item>A photograph of a famous celebrity caught in an embarrassing situation would not be eligible for preregistration, because this type of work does not advertise or market a particular product or service.</item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>For a definition and general discussion of the types of works that are eligible for preregistration, see Chapters 700, 800, and 900.</paragraph>

      <subsection_title><num>1603.3</num> A Portion of the Work Must Be Fixed</subsection_title>
      <paragraph>Copyright law protects “original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression” but it does not extend to “any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery.” <ref source="USC" title="17" section="102" subsections="a, b" cite="17 U.S.C. § 102(a), (b)">17 U.S.C. § 102(a), (b)</ref>. A work of authorship is not eligible for preregistration unless the author began to create the work on or before the date that the application is submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office, and unless at least a portion of the work has been fixed in a tangible medium of expression as of that date. See <ref source="CFR" title="37" part="202" section="16" subsection="b" paragraph="2" subparagraph="ii" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.16(b)(2)(ii)">37 C.F.R. § 202.16(b)(2)(ii)</ref>. The amount of material needed to satisfy this requirement varies depending upon the nature of the work:</paragraph>
      <list>
        <item>If the work is a motion picture, the filming of the work must have commenced.</item>
        <item>If the work is a sound recording, the recording of the sounds must have begun.</item>
        <item>In the case of a musical composition, at least some of the work must have been fixed either in the form of musical notation or in a copy or phonorecord embodying a performance of some or all of the work.</item>
        <item>In the case of a literary work being prepared for publication in book form, the actual writing of the text of the book must be underway.</item>
        <item>For a computer program, at least some portion of the source code or object code must have been fixed.</item>
        <item>For an advertising or marketing photograph, the photograph must have been taken. In the case of a group of photographs intended for simultaneous publication, at least one of the photographs in the group must have been taken.</item>

Although a portion of the work must be fixed in a tangible medium of expression in order to seek preregistration, the applicant should not submit a copy or phonorecord of the work or any portion of the work with the application for preregistration. For a discussion of this issue, see Section 1606.7.</paragraph>

    <subsection label="1603.4" id="subsec-1603-4">
      <subsection_title><num>1603.4</num> The Work Must Be Unpublished</subsection_title>
      <paragraph>Preregistration protects unpublished works that are being prepared for commercial distribution.

Therefore, the U.S. Copyright Office will not entertain an application for preregistration unless the work is unpublished as of the date that the application is submitted. The Copyright Act defines publication as “the distribution of copies or phonorecords of a work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending.” <ref source="USC" title="17" section="101" cite="17 U.S.C. § 101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref>. In addition, “offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution, public performance, or public display, constitutes publication.” For example, a sound recording is considered published if it has been offered to a group of disc jockeys for purposes of public air play, and a motion picture is considered published if it has been delivered to a number of distributors for purposes of theatrical exhibition.

Ct." page="892" court_year="2019" cite="Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp., 139 S. Ct. at 892">Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp., 139 S. Ct. at 892</ref>. However, if an infringement occurred within two months after the first publication of the work, the application, deposit, and filing fee must be received in proper form within one month after the copyright owner learned of the infringement or within three months after the first publication of the work (whichever is earlier). See <ref source="USC" title="17" sections="408(f)(3), 411(a), 412" cite="17 U.S.C. §§ 408(f)(3), 411(a), 412">17 U.S.C. §§ 408(f)(3), 411(a), 412</ref>.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If a preregistered work is not registered within the prescribed time period, a district court must dismiss any action involving an infringement that occurred before or within two months after the first publication of that work. See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408" subsection="f" paragraph="4" cite="17 U.S.C. § 408(f)(4)">17 U.S.C. § 408(f)(4)</ref>. If the infringement began more than two months after the first publication of a preregistered work, this rule does not apply. In other words, the failure to register a preregistered work before the deadline specified in <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408" subsection="f" paragraph="4" subparagraphs="A, B" cite="Sections 408(f)(4)(A) and (B) of the Copyright Act">Sections 408(f)(4)(A) and (B) of the Copyright Act</ref> will not prevent a copyright owner from registering that work and pursuing an infringement action, provided that the infringement occurred more than two months after the first publication of that work.

      <subsection_title><num>1604.2</num> Uses of Preregistration</subsection_title>
      <paragraph>A preregistration is not a registration. Nor is it a substitute for a registration. It “serves only as a preliminary step prior to a full registration.” <ref source="CASE" case_name="Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp." volume="139" reporter="S. Ct." page="888" court_year="2019" cite="Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp., 139 S. Ct. at 888">Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp., 139 S. Ct. at 888</ref> (internal quotation omitted).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>As discussed in Section 1604.1, preregistration allows certain copyright owners to satisfy the requirements of <ref source="USC" title="17" sections="411(a), 412" cite="Sections 411(a) and 412 of the Copyright Act">Sections 411(a) and 412 of the Copyright Act</ref> by notifying the U.S. Copyright Office that the work is being prepared for commercial distribution. Copyright owners may benefit from this procedure if they have started to create a work of authorship that has not yet been completed, and if it is likely that a third party may infringe that work before it has been released to the public. But to preserve the benefits of this procedure, the copyright owner must seek an actual registration for the work promptly after it has been published or infringed. See id. at 888.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>There are certain features that preregistration does not possess. Unlike a registration, a preregistration does not constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright or the facts stated in the application for preregistration or in the notification of preregistration. Moreover, the fact that a work has been preregistered does not create any presumption that the Office will register the work if the applicant subsequently submits an application for registration. <ref source="CFR" title="37" part="202" section="16" subsection="c" paragraph="13" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.16(c)(13)">37 C.F.R. § 202.16(c)(13)</ref>; see also <ref source="FEDREG" volume="70" page="42286" date="2005-07-22" cite="Preregistration of Certain Unpublished Copyright Claims, 70 Fed.

      <paragraph>Preregistration is neither a prerequisite nor a precondition for copyright owners who wish to register their works with the Office. In other words, an original work of authorship may be registered regardless of whether that work has been preregistered or not.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If an applicant submits an application to register a work that has been preregistered, the application may or may not be assigned to the same registration specialist who examined the application for preregistration. However, the specialist will not compare the information provided in the application for registration with the preregistration record to determine whether it is consistent with the information provided in the application for preregistration.</paragraph>

    <section_title><num>1605</num> Preregistration for a Sound Recording Distinguished from a Preregistration for a Musical Composition</section_title>
    <paragraph>As a general rule, a preregistration for a motion picture extends to any sounds that may accompany that work, because a soundtrack falls within the statutory definition of a “motion picture.” See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="101" cite="17 U.S.C. § 101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref> (stating that: “‘Motion pictures’ are audiovisual works” and that “‘Audiovisual works’ are works that consist of a series of related images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines or devices such as projectors, viewers, or electronic equipment, together with accompanying sounds, if any”). A preregistration for a sound recording does not, in and of itself, constitute a preregistration of the musical works that may be embodied in that recording. See <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="109-33" part="1" page="5" year="2005" cite="H.R. REP. NO. 109-33, pt. 1, at 5 (2005), reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 220, 224">H.R. REP. NO. 109-33, pt. 1, at 5 (2005), reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 220, 224</ref>. However, a claimant that owns the copyright in both a sound recording and a musical work embodied within that recording may preregister both the sound recording and the musical work with the same application.

    <section_title><num>1607</num> Examination Guidelines</section_title>
    <paragraph>Because a preregistration does not constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright or the facts stated in the notification of preregistration, the registration specialist conducts only a limited review of an application for preregistration. Specifically, the specialist will ascertain whether the work described in the application falls within one of the classes of works that have had a history of infringement prior to authorized commercial release (as determined by the Register of Copyrights) and whether the applicant provided all of the necessary information specified in the application.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As a general rule, the registration specialist will not pass judgment on the adequacy of the written description of the work. However, the description is an important part of the preregistration record, and it is important to recognize that this record cannot be corrected, amended, or supplemented once the U.S. Copyright Office has issued a notification of preregistration. See Section 1612. In an action for infringement of a preregistered work, the court may evaluate the written description to determine whether it actually describes the work that allegedly has been infringed, taking into account the information available when the application was submitted and taking into account the applicant’s legitimate interest in protecting confidential information concerning the work.</paragraph>

    <section_title><num>1608</num> Notification of Preregistration</section_title>
    <paragraph>If the application for preregistration has been approved, the U.S. Copyright Office will issue a notification of preregistration to the person or organization named in the application as the correspondent. The Office will send the notification to the email address that the applicant provided on the Notification &amp; Certification section of the application.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The notification will include the preregistration number that has been assigned to the claim and the effective date of the preregistration. Preregistration numbers are not based on the nature of the work (i.e., a number beginning with the letters VA for a work of the visual arts or a number beginning with the letters PA for a work of the performing arts). Instead, they are numbered consecutively beginning with the prefix PRE, regardless of whether the work in question is a motion picture, a sound recording, a musical composition, a book, a computer program, a videogame, or an advertising or marketing photograph.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The notification of preregistration will remind the correspondent that the work should be registered in a timely manner to secure the full benefit of the preregistration, and that the preregistration number should be included in the application for a basic registration to ensure that the records for the preregistration and the basic registration will be cross-referenced with each other.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The notification of preregistration is the only notice that the Office will provide to the applicant or the claimant indicating that a preregistration has been made. The Office does not issue paper certificates for preregistrations.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The Office will make the preregistration record available to the public through its Public Catalog. This database is available through the Office’s website. Additionally, the Records, Research, and Certification Section will issue a certified copy of the notification of preregistration upon written request.

    <section_title><num>1612</num> No Corrections or Cancellations</section_title>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office conducts only a limited review of an application for preregistration, because a preregistration does not constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright or the facts stated in the notification of preregistration. Consequently, a preregistration will not be cancelled, corrected, supplemented, or amended once it has been entered in the public record. For example, the Office will not expunge a preregistration from its records if the applicant incorrectly described the work or made other errors in the application. Nor will the Office accept an application for a supplementary registration to correct or amplify the information in the preregistration record. See Chapter 1800, Section 1802.4.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To correct a preregistration record, the applicant may submit another application containing the corrected or omitted information. The new effective date of preregistration is the day on which the Office receives the new filing fee and the new application, which are later determined by the U.S. Copyright Office or a court of competent jurisdiction to be acceptable for preregistration. See Section 1609.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the work has been completed, the applicant may submit an application for a basic registration that contains the correct or missing information, instead of submitting a new application for a new preregistration.</paragraph>
