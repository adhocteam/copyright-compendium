        <section_title><num>501</num> What This Chapter Covers</section_title>
        <paragraph>This Chapter provides guidance on how to identify the work that the applicant intends to register with the U.S. Copyright Office. It explains how to identify the copyrightable authorship that can be submitted for registration, and how to describe the claim to copyright in that authorship, particularly if the work contains multiple forms of authorship, if it was created by multiple authors, if the authorship is owned by multiple copyright owners, or if the applicant intends to register only a portion of the authorship that appears in the work. In addition, this Chapter assists copyright owners, courts, and the general public in understanding the scope of a registered copyright claim.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>When applying to register a work of authorship, it is crucial to correctly identify the work in which copyright is claimed, including the type of work, the author(s) who created that work, and the copyright owner who is entitled to claim copyright in that work. This Chapter provides a general overview of certain forms of authorship and ownership that are recognized under the copyright law, including joint works, works made for hire, derivative works, compilations, and collective works.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>For a discussion of the Office’s practices and procedures for registering a claim to copyright, see the following chapters:</paragraph>

            <item>For a general overview of the registration process, see Chapter 200.</item>

        <section_title><num>502</num> A Copyright Registration Covers a Claim in a Work of Original Authorship</section_title>
        <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office does not issue copyrights, but instead simply registers claims to copyright. See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408" subsection="a" cite="17 U.S.C. § 408(a)">(stating that “the owner of copyright or of any exclusive right in the work may obtain registration of the copyright claim” by submitting an appropriate application, filing fee, and deposit to the Copyright Office)</ref>. The copyright in a work of authorship created or first published after January 1, 1978 is protected from the moment it is created, provided that the work is original and is fixed in a tangible medium of expression. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="102" subsection="a" cite="17 U.S.C. §§ 102(a)">17 U.S.C. §§ 102(a)</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408" subsection="a" cite="17 U.S.C. § 408(a)">408(a)</ref>. In other words, the copyright in a work of original authorship exists regardless of whether the work has been submitted for registration or whether the Office has issued a certificate of registration for that work. See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408" subsection="a" cite="17 U.S.C. § 408(a)">17 U.S.C. § 408(a)</ref> (“registration is not a condition of copyright protection”).</paragraph>
        <paragraph>A copyright “claim” is an “assertion of copyright [ownership in] . . . the work.” <ref source="FEDREG" volume="42" page="48944" page_end="48945" date="Sept. 26, 1977" cite="Applications for Registration of Claim to Copyright Under Revised Copyright Act, 42 Fed. Reg. 48,944, 48,945 (Sept. 26, 1977)">Applications for Registration of Claim to Copyright Under Revised Copyright Act, 42 Fed. Reg. 48,944, 48, 945 (Sept. 26, 1977)</ref>. Thus, when an applicant files an application to register a work of authorship, the applicant is asserting a claim of ownership in the copyright in that work.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Although registration is optional, there are important benefits for registering a claim to copyright and for doing so in a timely manner. For a discussion of these benefits, see Chapter 200, Section 202.</paragraph>

    <section label="503" id="sec-503">
        <section_title><num>503</num> Identifying the Original Authorship That the Applicant Intends to Register</section_title>
        <paragraph>A copyright claim is a claim in the original authorship that an author or authors contributed to the work. The applicant — not the U.S. Copyright Office — must identify the original authorship that the applicant intends to register. In making this determination, the applicant may find it helpful to consider the following questions:</paragraph>
        <list>
            <item>What is the work of authorship?</item>
            <item>Who is the author(s) of the work?</item>
            <item>What type(s) of authorship did the author or co-authors create?</item>
            <item>Who owns the copyright in that authorship?</item>
            <item>Does the work contain unclaimable material?</item>
        </list>
        <paragraph>Each of these topics is discussed in Sections 503.1 through 503.5 below.</paragraph>
        <subsection label="503.1" id="subsec-503-1">

                <provision_title><num>503.1(A)</num> Works of Authorship Distinguished from the Constituent Elements of the Work</provision_title>
                <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office registers claims to copyright in works of authorship. As a general rule, the Office will issue one registration for each work that is submitted for registration.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>The Office may examine the constituent elements or individual components of a work to determine if the work contains a sufficient amount of creative expression to warrant registration. But as a general rule, the Office will not issue separate registrations for the constituent elements or individual components of a work of authorship. Likewise, the Office will not issue separate registrations to each author who contributed copyrightable expression to a work of authorship (except as contributions to a collective work or derivative works).</paragraph>

                <paragraph>A work may be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office, provided that it falls within one or more of the categories of authorship set forth under Section 102(a) of the Copyright Act. Works that do not fall within one or more of these congressionally-established categories do not constitute copyrightable subject matter, and as such, cannot be registered.</paragraph>
                <paragraph>Section 102(a) of the Copyright Act states that works of authorship include the following categories of works:</paragraph>
                <list>
                    <item>Literary works.</item>
                    <item>Musical works, including any accompanying words.</item>
                    <item>Dramatic works, including any accompanying music.</item>

Thus, when completing an application, the applicant should describe the copyrightable authorship that the author contributed to the work, rather than the medium that the author used to create that work. The U.S. Copyright Office cannot register a claim based solely on the method that the author used to create his or her expression or the medium in which the expression has been fixed.</paragraph>

        <section_title><num>504</num> The Scope of a Registration for a Work of Original Authorship</section_title>
        <paragraph>As a general rule, a registration for a work of authorship covers the entire copyrightable content of the authorship that (i) is claimed in the application, (ii) is owned by the claimant, and (iii) is contained in the deposit copy(ies).</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The applicant should assert a claim in this authorship in the online application by completing the Author Created field, and if appropriate, the New Material Included field. In the paper application, the applicant should assert a claim in this authorship by completing the Nature of Authorship space, and if appropriate, the Material Added to This Work space. Together, these fields and spaces provide important information about the scope of the claim of authorship in a work. Applicants are encouraged to be specific when completing these portions of the application. A clear description of the copyrightable expression that the applicant intends to register creates an accurate record of authorship and ownership for the benefit of the copyright owner, the courts, and the general public.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The fact that a work was submitted for registration and was registered by the U.S. Copyright Office does not necessarily mean that the registration covers all the authorship that appears in the work as a whole. As discussed in Sections 503.3 and 504.3, the Office examines and registers only the copyrightable authorship that is expressly claimed in the application and that is included in the deposit copy(ies). The Office does not examine any authorship that is not claimed or any authorship that has been disclaimed in the application, and the Office cannot examine any authorship that does not appear in the deposit copy(ies).</paragraph>
        <subsection label="504.1" id="subsec-504-1">
            <subsection_title><num>504.1</num> Copyrightable Authorship vs. Uncopyrightable Material</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>A registration covers the copyrightable authorship that the author or co-authors contributed to the work, but it does not cover any uncopyrightable material that appears in the work.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If the applicant expressly asserts a claim in uncopyrightable material, the registration specialist may communicate with the applicant. In the alternative, the specialist may remove the uncopyrightable term from the application and register the claim with an annotation indicating that the registration does not cover that material. See Chapter 600, Section 604. The annotation is intended to put the copyright owner, the courts, and the general public on notice concerning the extent of the claim. That said, a registration does not extend to uncopyrightable material that appears in a work of authorship, even if the registration does not contain an annotation or even if it contains ambiguous language that may refer to uncopyrightable material.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>504.2</num> Authorship Contained in the Deposit Copy(ies)</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>Ordinarily, a registration for a work of authorship only covers the material that is included in the deposit copy(ies). It does not cover authorship that does not appear in the deposit copy(ies), even if the applicant expressly claims that authorship in the application.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>There are two limited exceptions to this rule:</paragraph>
            <list>
                <item>In some cases, an applicant may register a work of authorship by submitting identifying portions of the work. For example, an applicant may register a computer program by submitting a portion of the source code for that work, rather than a complete copy of the entire program.</item>
                <item>In exceptional cases, the U.S. Copyright Office may grant special relief from the deposit requirements for a particular work.</item>
            </list>
            <paragraph>A work of authorship that is registered with identifying material or based on a grant of special relief may cover the entire copyrightable content of the work, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant did not submit a copy of the entire work. For a discussion of special relief and examples of other works that may be registered with identifying material, see Chapter 1500, Sections 1506 and 1508.8.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>504.3</num> Multiple Versions of the Same Work</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>A registration only covers the specific version of the work that is submitted for registration. The U.S. Copyright Office does not offer so-called “blanket registrations” that cover prior versions or derivative versions of the same work. For example, a registration for a published website covers the text, photographs, or other copyrightable content that appeared on that website on the date(s) claimed in the application and specified in the deposit copy(ies), but it does not cover any future version of that website. Similarly, a registration for version 1.30 of a computer program does not cover version 1.20 or any previously published or previously registered content that appears in the later version of that program. For the same reason, a registration for a comic book that depicts or describes a particular character covers the expression set forth in that issue, but it does not cover the character per se or any other issue or other work that features the same character.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>505.1</num> What Is a Joint Work?</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>The Copyright Act defines a joint work as a work “prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.” <ref source="USC" title="17" section="101" cite="17 U.S.C. § 101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>A work of authorship is considered a joint work “if the authors collaborated with each other, or if each of the authors prepared his or her contribution with the knowledge and intention that it would be merged with the contributions of other authors as ‘inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.’” <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="120" year="1976" cite="H.R.

REP. NO. 94-473, at 103-04</ref>. The key requirement “is the intention, at the time the writing is done, that the parts be absorbed or combined into an integrated unit.” <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="120" year="1976" cite="H.R.

            <paragraph>A contribution to a joint work is considered “inseparable” if the work contains a single form of authorship, such as a novel or painting, and it is considered “interdependent” if the work contains multiple forms of authorship, such as motion picture, opera, or the music and lyrics of a song.

            <subsection_title><num>505.2</num> Determining Whether the Work Is a Joint Work</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>The applicant — not the U.S. Copyright Office — must determine whether a work qualifies as a joint work, and as the legislative history explains, this determination should be based on the facts that existed when the work was created. See <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="120" year="1976" cite="H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 120, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5736">H.R. REP.

NO. 94-473, at 103</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>When examining a joint work, the Office applies U.S. copyright law, even if the work was created in a foreign country, created by a citizen, domiciliary, or habitual resident of a foreign country, or first published in a foreign country. The U.S. Copyright Act is the exclusive source of copyright protection in the United States, and all applicants — both foreign and domestic — must demonstrate that a work satisfies the requirements of U.S. copyright law in order to register a work with the Office.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Upon request, the Office will provide the applicant with general information about the provisions of the Copyright Act, including the statutory definition for a joint work, and will explain the relevant practices and procedures for registering this type of work. However, the Office cannot provide specific legal advice on the rights of persons, issues involving a particular use of a copyrighted work, cases of alleged foreign or domestic copyright infringement, contracts between authors and publishers, or other matters of a similar nature. <ref source="CFR" title="37" section="201.2" subsection="a" subsubsection="3" cite="37 C.F.R. § 201.2(a)(3)">37 C.F.R. § 201.2(a)(3)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>When completing the application, the applicant should provide the name of each joint author who contributed copyrightable authorship to the joint work. The Office takes the position that each joint author must contribute a sufficient amount of original authorship to the work. An author who satisfies this requirement may be considered a joint author, even if his or her contribution to the work is smaller or less significant than the contributions made by another author. By contrast, a collaborator who merely contributes a de minimis amount of expression is not considered a joint author. See Chapter 300, Section 313.4(B).</paragraph>
            <paragraph>As a general rule, the registration specialist will accept the applicant’s representation that a work of authorship is a joint work, unless it is contradicted by information provided elsewhere in the registration materials or in the Office’s records, or by information that is known to the specialist. If the claim appears implausible, the specialist may communicate with the applicant or may refuse registration. Examples of factors that may indicate that a work does not qualify as a joint work include the following:</paragraph>
            <list>
                <item>Evidence that one or more of the authors did not intend to merge their contributions into a unitary whole.</item>
                <item>A work containing a number of separate and independent works, such as a book of photographs by different authors.</item>
                <item>A work containing a major contribution from one author combined with a minor contribution by another author, such as a book containing hundreds of pages of text by one author and an introduction or a few illustrations by another author.</item>

                <item>Dave Muller is a full time chemist for Continental Chemicals. Dave created a computer program that evaluates the company’s products. By eliminating the need to perform mathematical calculations by hand, the program improved the efficiency of the company’s operations. Continental subsequently asked Dave to develop similar programs for its other products. Dave wrote and tested these programs at home using his personal computer. He did not receive overtime or any additional pay for creating these programs. Each program is considered a work made for hire. Although Dave was not hired as a computer programmer, he was employed by Continental when he wrote these programs and he wrote the programs, at least in part, to further the company’s interests. Developing these programs was incidental to his responsibilities because they improved the quality control of the company’s operations. Dave specifically created the programs for the company’s products and it is unlikely that he would do this type of work on his own.

            <paragraph>Determining whether a work is a work made for hire has important implications for the term of the copyright, the ownership of the copyright, and the ability to terminate a transfer or license involving the copyright. See <ref source="CASE" case_name="Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid" volume="490" reporter="U.S." page="730" page_end="737" court_year="1989" cite="Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730, 737 (1989)">Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid, 490 U.S. 730, 737 (1989)</ref> (“Classifying a work as ‘made for hire’ determines not only the initial ownership of its copyright, but also the copyright’s duration . . . [and] termination rights.”). Therefore, the U.S. Copyright Office encourages applicants to exercise judgment when answering the work made for hire portion of the application.</paragraph>
            <list>
                <item>Copyright Term. The copyright in a work made for hire expires ninety-five years from the year of publication or one hundred twenty years from the year of creation (whichever is shorter). <ref source="USC" title="17" section="302" subsection="c" cite="17 U.S.C. § 302(c)">17 U.S.C. § 302(c)</ref>.</item>
                <item>Copyright Ownership. The copyright in a work made for hire initially belongs to the employer or the party that ordered or commissioned the work (rather than the individual who actually created the work). In other words, if the work was created by an employee acting within the scope of his or her employment, the employer owns the copyright in that work (not the employee). If the work was specially ordered or commissioned as a work made for hire, the person or organization that ordered or commissioned owns the copyright in that work (rather than the individual who actually created the work). <ref source="USC" title="17" section="201" subsection="b" cite="17 U.S.C. § 201(b)">17 U.S.C. § 201(b)</ref>.</item>
                <item>Termination. Under certain circumstances, an author or his or her heirs may terminate an exclusive or nonexclusive transfer or license of the copyright in the author’s work by exercising the author’s right to terminate a grant under Sections <ref source="USC" title="17" section="203" cite="17 U.S.C. § 203">203</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="17" section="304" subsection="c" cite="17 U.S.C. § 304(c)">304(c)</ref>, and <ref source="USC" title="17" section="304" subsection="d" cite="17 U.S.C. § 304(d)">304(d)</ref> of the Copyright Act. However, these termination provisions do not apply to grants involving the copyright in a work made for hire. For a general discussion of termination, see Chapter 2300, Section 2310.</item>

            <subsection_title><num>507.1</num> What Is a Derivative Work?</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>The Copyright Act defines a derivative work as “a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgement, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.” The statute also states that “[a] work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a ‘derivative work.’” <ref source="USC" title="17" section="101" cite="17 U.S.C. § 101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Creating a derivative work requires “a process of recasting, transforming, or adapting ‘one or more preexisting works.’” <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="57" year="1976" cite="H.R.

NO. 94-473 at 55</ref>. Thus, derivative works contain two distinct forms of authorship:</paragraph>
            <list>
                <item>The authorship in the preexisting work(s) that has been recast, transformed, or adapted within the derivative work, and</item>

            </list>
            <paragraph>The new authorship that the author contributed to the derivative work may be registered, provided that it contains a sufficient amount of original authorship.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>As the legislative history explains, derivative works include “every copyrightable work that employs preexisting material . . . of any kind,” regardless of whether the preexisting material is protected by copyright or whether the copyright in that material has expired. <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="57" year="1976" cite="H.R.

            <subsection_title><num>507.2</num> The Scope of the Copyright in a Derivative Work</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>The copyright for a derivative work only covers the new material that the author contributed to that work. It does not cover any of the preexisting material that appears in the derivative work. See <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="57" year="1976" cite="H.R. REP.

NO. 94-473, at 55</ref> (“[C]opyright in a ‘new version’ covers only the material added by the later author, and has no effect one way or the other on the copyright or public domain status of the preexisting material.”). Likewise, a registration for a derivative work does not cover any previously published material, previously registered material, public domain material, or third party material that appears in the work. In other words, the copyright in a derivative work is “independent of, and does not affect or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any copyright protection in the preexisting material.” <ref source="USC" title="17" section="103" subsection="b" cite="17 U.S.C. § 103(b)">17 U.S.C. § 103(b)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Derivative works often contain previously published material, previously registered material, public domain material, or material owned by a third party because by definition they are based upon one or more preexisting works. If a derivative work contains an appreciable amount of unclaimable material, the applicant generally should limit the claim to the new material that the author contributed to the work, and the unclaimable material should be excluded from the claim. For guidance on this procedure, see Chapter 600, Section 621.8. By contrast, there is generally no need to limit the claim if the derivative work is solely based on or derived from unpublished material, unregistered material, or copyrightable material that is owned by the claimant named in the application.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The author of a derivative work may claim copyright in a work that recasts, transforms, or adapts a preexisting work, provided that the preexisting material has been used in a lawful manner. Section 103(a) of the Copyright Act states that the copyright in a derivative work “does not extend to any part of the work” that “unlawfully” uses preexisting material. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="103" subsection="a" cite="17 U.S.C. § 103(a)">17 U.S.C. § 103(a)</ref>. As discussed in Chapter 300, Section 313.6(B), this provision is intended to prevent “an infringer from benefiting, through copyright protection, from committing an unlawful act.” <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="57" year="1976" cite="H.R.

            <paragraph>The fact that a compilation has been registered with the U.S. Copyright Office does not necessarily mean that every element of the work is protected by copyright. A claim to copyright in a compilation “extends only to the material contributed by the author of such work” and does not “imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material.” <ref source="USC" title="17" section="103" subsection="b" cite="17 U.S.C. § 103(b)">17 U.S.C. § 103(b)</ref>. The data, facts, or other uncopyrightable material that appears in a compilation is not protected by the copyright in that work. See <ref source="CASE" case_name="Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co." volume="499" reporter="U.S." page="340" page_end="360" court_year="1991" cite="Feist Publications, Inc. v.

Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340, 360 (1991)</ref> (stating that “the copyright in a compilation does not extend to the facts it contains”). A registration for a compilation does not cover any of the preexisting material or data that appears in the compilation unless that material or data is expressly claimed in the registration. Likewise, a registration for a compilation does not cover any previously published material, previously registered material, public domain material, or third party material that appears in the compilation. “This inevitably means that the copyright in a factual compilation is thin. Notwithstanding a valid copyright, a subsequent compiler remains free to use the facts contained in another’s publication to aid in preparing a competing work, so long as the competing work does not feature the same selection and arrangement.” Id. <ref source="CASE" case_name="Feist Publications, Inc. v.

            <paragraph>When registering a compilation, the applicant should identify the preexisting material or data that the author selected, coordinated, and/or arranged. If the compilation contains an appreciable amount of previously published material, previously registered material, public domain material, or material owned by a third party, the applicant generally should limit the claim to the new material that the author contributed to the work and the unclaimable material should be excluded from the claim.

            <paragraph>The author of a compilation may claim copyright in an original selection, coordination, and/or arrangement of preexisting material, provided that the material has been used in a lawful manner. Section 103(a) of the Copyright Act states that the copyright in a compilation “does not extend to any part of the work” that “unlawfully” uses preexisting material.

            <subsection_title><num>509.1</num> What Is a Collective Work?</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>A collective work is a type of compilation. The Copyright Act defines a collective work as “a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.” <ref source="USC" title="17" section="101" cite="17 U.S.C. § 101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref>. The statute also states that “[t]he term ‘compilation’ includes collective works.” Id. (definition of “compilation”). Thus, collective works are subject to the statutory requirements for compilations: There must be a sufficiently creative selection, coordination, or arrangement of the component works to establish a collective work.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Creating a collective work requires the “assemblage or gathering of ‘separate and independent works . . . into a collective whole.’” <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="120" year="1976" cite="H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 120, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5736">H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 120, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5736</ref>; <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="S" number="94-473" page="104" year="1975" cite="S. REP. NO. 94-473, at 104">S. REP. NO. 94-473, at 104</ref> (omission in original). In other words, collective works contain two distinct forms of authorship:</paragraph>
            <list>
                <item>The compilation authorship in creating the collective work, which involves selecting, coordinating, and/or arranging a number of separate and independent works and assembling them into a collective whole; and</item>
                <item>The authorship in the separate and independent works included within the collective work, such as an article that appears in a periodical issue or a poem that appears in an anthology.</item>
            </list>
            <paragraph>An applicant may register a collective work together with the separate and independent works contained therein (i) if the copyright in the collective work and the component works are owned by the same claimant, and (ii) if the component works have not been previously published, previously registered, and are not in the public domain.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>By definition, a collective work must contain “a number of contributions.” A work that contains “relatively few separate elements” does not satisfy this requirement, such as a work containing a single contribution, a composition that merely consists of words and music, a publication that merely combines a single work with illustrations or front matter, or a publication that merely contains three one-act plays. <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="122" year="1976" cite="H.R.

            <paragraph>As a general rule, a contribution that is “incorporated in a ‘collective work’ must itself constitute a ‘separate and independent’ work.” <ref source="CONGR_REPORT" type="H" number="94-1476" page="122" year="1976" cite="H.R.

See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408" subsection="a" cite="17 U.S.C. §§ 408(a)">17 U.S.C. §§ 408(a)</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="17" section="409" cite="17 U.S.C. § 409">409</ref> (authorizing the U.S. Copyright Office to register a single “work”).</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Although the Office generally allows only one work per application, there are some limited exceptions to this rule. In the following cases, it may be possible to register multiple works with one application, one filing fee, and one set of deposit copy(ies):</paragraph>
        <list>
            <item>A collective work may be registered together with the separate and independent works contained therein (i) if the copyright in the collective work and the component works are owned by the same claimant, and (ii) if the component works have not been previously published, previously registered, and are not in the public domain. This option is discussed in Section 509.1 and Chapter 600, Sections 610.4, 613.8, 618.7, 620.8, and 621.8(D).</item>
            <item>A number of published works may be registered using the unit of publication option, which is discussed in Chapter 1100, Section 1103.</item>
            <item>A sound recording may be registered together with a literary work, musical work, or dramatic work, provided that (i) the sound recording and the recorded literary work, musical work, or dramatic work are embodied in the same phonorecord, (ii) the claimant for both works is the same person or organization, (iii) the applicant selects Sound Recording from the Type of Work field when completing an online application or uses Form SR when completing a paper application, and (iv) the applicant submits a phonorecord that contains both the sound recording and the recorded literary work, musical work, or dramatic work.</item>
            <item>A group of related works may be registered using a group registration option. The Office currently offers group registration options for the following types of works:</item>
            <list>
                <item>Unpublished works.</item>
                <item>Serials</item>

                <item>Newsletters</item>
                <item>Short online literary works</item>
                <item>Contributions to periodicals</item>
                <item>Published photographs</item>
                <item>Unpublished photographs</item>
                <item>Database updates</item>
                <item>Questions, answers, and other test items that have been prepared for use in a secure test.</item>
            </list>

        <section_title><num>512</num> Multiple Versions of the Same Work</section_title>
        <paragraph>The Copyright Act states that “a work is ‘created’ when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first time.” <ref source="USC" title="17" section="101" cite="17 U.S.C. § 101">17 U.S.C. § 101</ref> (definition of “created”). The statute states that “where a work is prepared over a period of time, the portion of [the work] that has been fixed at any particular time constitutes the work as of that time.” Id. It also states that “where the work has been prepared in different versions, each version constitutes a separate work.” Id.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The copyright law protects each version of a work from the moment it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord, provided that the author contributed a sufficient amount of original expression to that version. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="102" subsection="a" cite="17 U.S.C. § 102(a)">17 U.S.C. § 102(a)</ref>. For example, copyright protects each draft of a literary work from the moment it is written on paper, saved in a data file, or inscribed in any other medium of expression. Likewise, it protects each take of a motion picture from the moment it is captured on film, videotape, or any other audiovisual medium.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Although the copyright law generally protects each version of a work, it may not be necessary to register each version with the U.S. Copyright Office, depending on whether the work is published or unpublished. These issues are discussed in Sections 512.1 and 512.2 below.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>512.1</num> Unpublished Versions of the Same Work</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>If the work is unpublished, there is generally no need to register each version of that work. In most cases, the applicant may submit the most recent or the most complete version.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For example, if the author prepared multiple drafts for an unpublished screenplay, a registration for the most recent version will cover all of the copyrightable material that appears in the deposit copy, including any unpublished expression that has been incorporated from prior versions of the same work. Likewise, if the applicant intends to register an unpublished website that has been updated, modified, or revised from time to time, the registration will cover all of the copyrightable material that is submitted for registration, including any unpublished text, photographs, or other content that has been incorporated from prior iterations of the same website.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If the deposit copy contains copyrightable material that appeared in previous versions of the same work there is generally no need to exclude that preexisting material from the application unless that material has been previously published or previously registered or unless that material is in the public domain or is owned by a third party.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>512.2</num> Published Versions of the Same Work</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>If the versions have been published, the applicant generally should submit a separate application, a separate filing fee, and a separate set of deposit copies for each version.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>For example, if the author published multiple editions of a textbook, the applicant should submit a separate application for each edition. In each case, the registration will cover the new material that the author contributed to each edition, including any copyrightable changes, revisions, additions, or other modifications that appear in the deposit copies for that edition. Likewise, if the applicant intends to register a published website that has been updated, modified, or revised from time to time, the applicant should prepare a separate application for each version of that site. In each case, the registration will cover the text, photographs, or other copyrightable content that appeared on the website on the date specified in the application and the deposit copies.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Office will register multiple versions of a published work, provided that each version contains a sufficient amount of copyrightable authorship that does not appear in the other versions. When submitting multiple versions of a published work for registration, the applicant should notify the Office by providing the title for each version, and if possible, the case number / service request number that has been assigned to each claim. In addition, the applicant should confirm in writing that the version specified in the application contains copyrightable authorship that does not appear in other versions. When filing an online application this information should be provided in the Note to Copyright Office field. When filing a paper application this information should be provided in a cover letter. This improves the efficiency of the examination process and produces more consistent registration decisions.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The applicant —not the U.S. Copyright Office —should identify the specific version or versions that the applicant intends to register. In making this determination, it may be helpful to consider the following questions:</paragraph>
            <list>
                <item>Does one version contain all of the copyrightable material that appears in the other versions of the same work?</item>
                <item>Were the versions published on the same date or on different dates?</item>
            </list>
            <paragraph>These topics are discussed in Sections 512.2(A) through 512.2(C) below.</paragraph>

                <paragraph>If one version contains all the copyrightable material that appears in other versions of the same work and if that version was published first, the applicant should submit the most complete version. In this situation, the applicant should not submit an application to register other versions of the same work.</paragraph>

The teacher’s edition contains all the text and artwork that appears in the student’s edition, plus additional instructions, questions, answers, and commentary. The teacher’s edition was published on January 22, 2010 and the student’s edition was published on February 1, 2010. The publisher may register the teacher’s edition, but should not submit an application for the student’s edition.</item>

                <paragraph>If one version contains some —but not all —of the copyrightable material that appears in other versions of the same work and if that version was published first, the applicant may register any or all of those versions. When completing the application for the more complete version(s) the applicant should exclude any material that appeared in the previously published versions of the same work using the procedure described in Chapter 600, Section 621.8.</paragraph>

                    <item>The Block Island Press published a calendar on June 1, 2011 that contains a number of photographs. On June 15, 2011, the company published a coffee table book containing the same photographs and some additional sketches. The publisher may submit a separate application for the calendar and the book. When completing the application for the calendar, the publisher should assert a claim in the photographs. When completing an application for the book, the publisher should assert a claim in the artwork, and should exclude the previously published photographs from the claim.</item>
