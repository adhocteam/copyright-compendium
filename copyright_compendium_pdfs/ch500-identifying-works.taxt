Identifying the Work(s) Covered  
by a Registration  
 501 What This Chapter Covers  
This Chapter provides guidance on how to identify the work that the applicant intends 
to register with the U.S. Copyright Office. It explains how to identify the  copyrightable  
authorship that can be submitted for registration, and how to describe the claim  to 
copyright in that authorship, particu larly if the work contains multiple forms of 
authorship, if it was created by multiple authors, if the authorship is owned by multiple 
copyright owners, or if the applicant intends to register only a portion of the author ship 
that appears in the work. In addition, this Chapter assists copyright owners, courts, and 
the general public in understanding the scope of a registered copyright claim.  
When applying to register a work of authorship, it is crucial to correctly identify the 
work in which copyright is cl aimed, including the type of work, the author(s) who 
created that work, and the copyright owner who is entitled to claim copyright in that 
work. This Chapter provides a general overview of certain forms of authorship and 
ownership that are recognized under  the copyright law, including joint works , works 
made for hire , derivativ e works , compilations , and collective works .

 502 A Copyright Registration Covers a Claim in a Work of Original Authorship  
The U.S. Copyright Office does not issue copyrights, but instead simply registe rs claims 
to copyright. See 17 U.S.C. § 408(a)  (stating that “the owner of copyright or of any 
exclusive right in the work may obtain registration of the copyright claim” by submitting 
an appropriate application, filing fee, and deposit to the Copyright Office). The copyright 
in a work of authorship created or first published  after January 1, 1978 is protected 
from the moment it is created, provided that the work is original and is fixed  in a 
tangible medium of expression. 17 U.S.C. §§ 102(a) , 408(a) . In other words, the copyright 
in a work of original authorship exists regardless of whether the work has been 
submitted for registration or whether the Office has issued a certificate  of registration  
for that work. See 17 U.S.C. § 408(a)  (“registration is not a condition of copyright 
protection”).  
A copyright “claim” is an “assertion of copyright [ownership in] . . . the work.” 
Applications for Registration of Claim to Copyright Under Revised Copyright Act, 42 Fed. 
Reg. 48,944, 48, 945 (Sept. 26, 1977) . Thus, when an applicant files an application to 
register a work of authorship, the applicant is asserting a claim of ownership in the 
copyright in that work.  
Although registration is optional, there are important benefits for register ing a claim to 
copyright and for doing so in a timely manner. For a discussion of these benefits, see 
Chapter 200 , Section 202.  
 503 Identifying the Original Authorship That the Applicant Intends to Register  
A copyright claim  is a claim in the original authorship that an author or authors 
contributed to the work. The applicant — not the U.S. Copyright Office — must i dentify 
the original authorship that the applicant intends to register. In making this 
determination, the applicant may find it helpful to consider the following questions:  
• What is the work of authorship?  
• Who is the author(s) of the work?  
• What type(s) of a uthorship did the author or co -authors create?  
• Who owns the copyright in that authorship?  
• Does the work contain unclaimable material?  
Each of these topics is discussed in Sections 503.1  through 503.5  below.  
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  5 01/28/2021   503.1  What Is the Work of Authorship?  
 503.1(A)  Works of Authorship Distinguished from the Constituent Elements of the Work  
The U.S. Copyright Office registers claims to copyright in works of authorship. As a 
general ru le, the Office will issue one registration for each work that is submitted for 
registration.  
The Office may examine the constituent elements or individual components of a work to 
determine if the work contains a sufficient amount of creative expression to  warrant 
registration. But as a general rule, the Office will not issue separate registrations for the 
constituent elements or individual components of a work of authorship. Likewise, the 
Office will not issue separate registrations to each author who cont ributed 
copyrightable expression to a work of authorship (except as contributions to a collective 
work or derivative works).  
 503.1(B)  Copyrightable Subject Matter  
A work may be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office, provided that it falls within one 
or more of the categories of authorship set forth under Section 102(a)  of the Copyright 
Act. Works that do not fall within one or more of these congressionally -established 
categories do  not constitute copyrightable  subject matter, and as such, cannot be registered.  
Section 102(a)  of the Copyright Act states  that works of authorship include the following 
categories of works:  
• Literary works . 
• Musical works, including any accompanying words.  
• Dramatic works, including any accompanying music.  
• Pantomimes  and choreographic works . 
• Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works . 
• Motion pictures  and other audiovisual works . 
• Sound recordings . 
• Architectural works . 
The following chart provides representative examples of works that may be registered 
and the relevant category of authorship for each work.

 503.1(C)  Compilations and Derivative Works  
The Copyright Act states that “[t]he subject matter of copyright as specified by secti on 
102 includes compilations and derivative works.” 17 U.S.C. § 103(a) . 
Compilations and derivative works constitute copyrig htable  subject matter, provided 
that the work falls within one or more of the categories of authorship set forth in Section 
102(a)  of the Act ( e.g., literary works, sound recordings , pictorial works, etc.). In other 
words, a compilation or derivative work may be copyrightable provided that it qualifies 
as a literary work , a musical work, a dramatic work, or one of the other congressionally -
established categories of authorship. A compilation or derivative work that does not fall 
within one or more of the Section 102(a)  categories is not registrable, such as a 
compilation of exercises or a new version of a useful article . Registration of Claims to 
Copyright, 77 Fed. Reg. 37,605, 37,606 (June 22, 2012).  
For a definition and discussion of compilations and derivative works, see Sections 507 
and 508. 
 503.1(D)  Work of Authorship Distinguished from the Medium of Expression  
A copyright registration covers the copyrightable  authorship that the author 
contributed to the work, but it does not cover the medium in wh ich the work has been 
fixed . See H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476,  at 53 (1976) , reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5666; 
S. REP. NO. 94-473,  at 52 (1975)  (recognizing that there is “a fundamental distinction 
between the ‘original work’ which is the product of ‘authorship’ and the multitude of 
material objects in whic h it can be embodied.”). Thus, when completing an application, 
the applicant should describe the copyrightable authorship that the author contributed 
to the work, rather than the medium that the author used to create that work. The U.S. 
Copyright Office ca nnot register a claim  based solely on the method that the author used 
to create his or her expression or the medium in which the expression has been fixed.  
The following chart provides representa tive examples of various types of works and the 
authorship they typically contain, as distinguished from the medium in which the 
authorship may be fixed. In these examples, the Office may register a claim to copyright 
in “2 -D artwork,” “music and lyrics,” “sound recording ,” or other forms of original 
authorship, but not in the “canvas,” “compact disc,” “digital music file,” or other medium 
that the author used to create the work.

 503.1(E)  Copyrightable Authorship  
When completing an application, the applicant should identify the copyrightable  
authorship that the author contributed to the work, but should not assert a claim  in any 
aspect of the work that is not protected by copyright. For more information on what 
constitutes uncopyrightable authorship, see Chapter  300 , Section 313.  
The following chart provides representative examples of various types of works and the 
copyrightable authorship they typically contain, as distinguished from the 
uncopyrightable material that may appear in the work. In these examples, th e Office 
may register a claim to copyright in the “text,” “photographs,” “artwork,” or other forms 
of copyrightable authorship that the author contributed to the work, but not the “facts,” 
“listing of ingredients,” “process,” “method,” “name,” “typeface,” “typographic 
ornamentation,” or other uncopyrightable material.

 503.2  Who Is the Author of the Work?  
The applicant should identify the author or co -authors who created the work that the 
applicant intends to register.  
If the work qualifies as a joint work , the applicant should identify each author who 
contributed copyrightable  authorship to that work. For a definition and discussion of 
joint works, see Section 505. 
If the work was created as a work made for hire , the employer for hire should be 
identified as the author. For a definition and discussion of works made for hire, see 
Section 506. 
The author or co -authors liste d in the application are presumed to be the sole authors or 
joint authors of the expression claimed therein. Although the U.S. Copyright Office does 
not investigate the truth of the claims asserted in the application, it does verify that the 
asserted autho rship facts are consistent with the facts contained in the deposit copy(ies) 
or elsewhere in the registration materials.  
For guidance in identifying the author of a work, see Chapter 600 , Sections 613.1 
through 613.8. For guidance in completing the name of author field/space of the 
application, see Chapter 600 , Section 613.9.  
 503.3  What Type o f Authorship Did the Author Create?  
The applicant should identify the copyrightable  authorship that the author or co -
authors contributed to the work.  
The U.S. Copyright Office only examines the authorship that is explicitly claimed in the 
application. It does not examine any authorship that is not claimed in the application, 
and therefore, no prima facie  presumption should apply to unclaimed authorship that 
appears in the work.  
A copyrightable work may contain one or more types of authorship, but as discussed in 
Section 503.4 , a registration only covers the authorship that is owned by the claimant  or 
co-claimants who are named in the application. In some cases, the applicant may intend 
and may be entitled to register all of the authorship that appears in the work, while in 
other cases the applicant may intend or may be e ntitled to register only certain aspects 
of the work.  
The following chart provides a representative example of a work that contains multiple 
types of authorship.

by Author A  Authorship Created  
by Author B  
Song  Musi c Lyrics  
 
In this example, the song contains two types of authorship created by two different 
authors. If the claimant only owns the copyright in the music, the applicant should assert 
a claim  in “music” a nd should name Author A in the application (but not Author B).  
If the claimant only owns the copyright in the lyrics, the applicant should assert a claim 
in “lyrics” and should name Author B in the application (but not Author A).  
By contrast, if the claim ant owns the copyright in the music and lyrics, the applicant 
should assert a claim in both elements and should name Authors A and B in the 
application.  
 503.4  Who Owns the Copyright in the Authorship?  
The applicant should identify the person or organizat ion that owns the copyrightable  
authorship that the author or co -authors contributed to the work. For purposes of 
copyright registration, this person or organization is known as the “ copyright claimant .”  
The copyright in a work of authorship initially belongs to the author or co -authors of 
that work, unless and until the author assigns the copyright to another party in a signed, 
written  agreement or by operation of law. 17 U.S.C. §§ 201(a) , 204(a) . If the author no 
longer owns the copyright in the work, the applicant must provide a brief statement that 
explains “how the claimant obtained ownership of the copyright.” 17 U.S.C. § 409(5) . For 
guidance in completing these portions of the application, see Chapter 600 , Sections 61 9 
and 620.  
As discussed in Section 503.3 , works of authorship often contain different forms of 
expression. In some cases, the copyright claimant may own all of the authorship that 
appears in the work, while in other cases the claim ant may own or may be entitled to 
register only certain aspects of the work. In all cases, the applicant should assert a claim  
only in the authorship that is owned by the claimant or co -claimants  named in the 
application.  
The following chart provides a representative example of a work that contains multiple 
types of authorship that is owned by multiple claimants.

Children’s Book  Text  Illustrations  Text, artwork, and 
photographs on the

If the claimant owns the copyright in the text of the book (but does not own the 
illustrations or any of the content that appears on the cover), the applicant should 
identify the author(s) of the text, the applicant should assert a claim in “text,” and the 
applicant should name A as the copyright claimant.  
If the claimant owns the copyright in the illustrations (but does not own the text of  the 
book or any of the content that appears on the cover), the applicant should identify the 
author(s) of those illustrations, the applicant should assert a claim in “2 -D artwork,” and 
the applicant should name B as the copyright claimant.  
 503.5  Does the  Work Contain Unclaimable Material?  
A copyright registration covers the new expression that the author created and 
contributed to the work, but it does not cover any unclaimable material that the work 
may contain. For purposes of registration, unclaimable  material includes the following:  
• Previously published  material.  
• Previously registered material (including material that has been submitted for 
registration but has not been registered yet).  
• Material that is in the public domain . 
• Copyrightable  material that is owned by a third party ( i.e., an individual or legal 
entity other t han the claimant  who is named in the application).  
For a definition and discussion of each type of unclaimable material, see Chapter 600 , 
Sections 621.4 through 621.7.  
If the work submitted for registration contains unclaimable material, the applicant 
should exclude that material from the claim  by providi ng a brief description in the 
Material Excluded field in the online application or in space 6(a) of the paper 
application. However, the applicant does not need to complete this portion of the 
application if the work merely contains material that is uncopyr ightable, such as words, 
letters, numbers, common symbols and shapes, and the like. Similarly, brief quotes, 
short phrases, and other de minimis  uses of prior works do not need to be excluded fro m 
the claim.  
For representative examples of works that contain unclaimable material, see Sections

 504 The Scope of a Registration for a Work of Original Authorship  
As a general rule, a registration for a work of authorship covers the entire copyrightable  
content of the authorship that (i) is clai med in the application, (ii) is owned by the 
claimant , and (iii) is contained in the deposit copy(ies) .  
The applicant should assert a  claim  in this authorship in the online application by 
completing the Author Created field, and if appropriate, the New Material Included field. 
In the paper application, the applicant should ass ert a claim in this authorship by 
completing the Nature of Authorship space, and if appropriate, the Material Added to 
This Work space. Together, these fields and spaces provide important information about 
the scope of the claim of authorship in a work. Ap plicants are encouraged to be specific 
when completing these portions of the application. A clear description of the 
copyrightable expression that the applicant intends to register creates an accurate 
record of authorship and ownership for the benefit of t he copyright owner, the courts, 
and the general public.

Chapter 500   :  14 01/28/2021  The fact that a work was submitted for registration and was registered by the U.S. 
Copyright Office does not necessarily mean that the registration covers all the 
authorship that appears in the work a s a whole. As discussed in Sections 503.3  and 
504.3 , the Office examines and registers only the copyrightable authorship that is 
expressly claimed in the application and that is included in the deposit copy (ies). The 
Office does not examine any authorship that is not claimed or any authorship that has 
been disclaimed in the application, and the Office cannot examine any authorship that 
does not appear in the deposit copy(ies).  
 504.1  Copyrightable Authorshi p vs. Uncopyrightable Material  
A registration covers the copyrightable  authorship that the author or co -authors 
contributed to the work, but it does not cover any uncopyrightable material that 
appears in the work.  
If the applicant expressly asserts a claim  in unco pyrightable material, the registration 
specialist  may communicate with the applicant. In the alternative, the specialist may 
remove the uncopyrightable term from the application and register the claim with an 
annotation indicating that the registration does not cover that material. See Chapter 600 , 
Section 604. The annotation is intended to put the copyright owner, the courts, and the 
general public on notice concerning the extent of the claim. That said, a registration does 
not extend to uncopyrightable material that appears in a work of authorship, even if the 
registration does not contain an annotation or even if it contains ambiguous language 
that may refer to uncopyrightable material.  
 504.2  Authorship Contained in the Deposit Copy(ies)  
Ordinarily, a registration for a work of authorship only covers the material that is 
included in the deposit copy(ies) . It does not cover authorship that does not appear in 
the deposit copy(ies), even if the applicant expressly claims  that authorship in the 
appl ication.  
There are two limited exceptions to this rule:  
• In some cases, an applicant may register a work of authorship by submitting 
identifying portions of the work. For example, an applicant may register a computer 
program  by submitting a portion of the source code  for that work, rather than a 
complete copy of the entire program.  
• In exceptional cases, the U.S. Copyright Office may gran t special relief from the 
deposit  requirements for a particular work.  
A work of authorship that is registered with identifying materi al or based on a grant of 
special relief may cover the entire copyrightable content of the work, notwithstanding 
the fact that the applicant did not submit a copy of the entire work. For a discussion of 
special relief and examples of other works that may b e registered with identifying 
material, see Chapter 1500 , Sections 1506 and 1508.8.

Chapter 500   :  15 01/28/2021   504.3  Multiple Versions of the Same Work  
A registration only covers the specific version of the wor k that is submitted for 
registration. The U.S. Copyright Office does not offer so -called “blanket registrations” 
that cover prior versions or derivative versions of the same work. For example, a 
registration for a published  website covers the text, photogr aphs, or other copyrightable  
content that appeared on that website on the date(s) claimed in the application and 
specified in the deposit copy(ies), but it does not cover any future version of that 
website. Similarly, a registration for version 1.30 of a c omputer program does not cover 
version 1.20 or any previously published or previously registered content that appears 
in the later version of that program. For the same reason, a registration for a comic book 
that depicts or describes a particular characte r covers the expression set forth in that 
issue, but it does not cover the character per se  or any other issue or other work that 
features the same character.  
For additional guidance in registering multiple versions of the same work, see Section 
512. 
 505 Joint Works  
This Section provides the definition and a general discussion concerning joint works . 
For specific guidance in preparing an application to register a joint wor k, see Chapter 
600, Sections 613.5 and 620.5.  
 505.1  What Is a Joint Work?  
The Copyright Act defines a joint wo rk as a work “prepared by two or more authors 
with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or 
interdependent parts of a unitary whole.” 17 U.S.C. § 101 .  
A wor k of authorship is considered a joint work “if the authors collaborated with each 
other, or if each of the authors prepared his or her contribution with the knowledge and 
intention that it would be merged with the contributions of other authors as 
‘insepar able or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.’” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476,  at 120 , 
reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5736; S. REP. NO. 94-473,  at 103 -04. The key 
requirement “is the intention, at the time the writing is done, that the parts be absorbed 
or combined into an integrated unit.” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476,  at 120 , reprinted in  1976 
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5736.  
A contribution to a joint work is considered “inseparable” if the work contains a single 
form of authorship, such as a novel or painti ng, and it is considered “interdependent” if 
the work contains multiple forms of authorship, such as motion picture, opera, or the 
music and lyrics of a song. Id.; S. REP. NO. 94-473,  at 103-04. 
 505.2  Determining Whether the Work Is a Joint Work  
The applicant — not the U.S. Copyright Office — must determine whether a work 
qualifies as a joint work , and as the legislative histo ry explains, this determination 
should be based on the facts that existed when the work was created. See H.R.  REP. NO. 
94-1476,  at 120 , reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5736; S. REP. NO. 94-473,  at 103 . 
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  16 01/28/2021  When examining a joint work, the Office applies U.S. copyright law, even if the work was 
created in a foreign country, created by a citizen, domiciliary, or habitual r esident of a 
foreign country, or first published  in a foreign country. The U.S. Copyright Act is the 
exclusive source of copyright protection in the United States, and all applicants — both 
foreign and domestic — must demonstrate that a work satisfies the requirements of U.S. 
copyright law in order to register a work with the Office.  
Upon request, the Office will provide the applicant with general information about the 
provisions of the Copyright Act, including the statutory definition for a joint work, and  
will explain the relevant practices and procedures for registering this type of work. 
However, the Office cannot provide specific legal advice on the rights of persons, issues 
involving a particular use of a copyrighted work, cases of alleged foreign or d omestic 
copyright infringement , contracts between authors and publishers, or other matters of a 
similar nature. 37 C.F.R. § 20 1.2(a)(3) .  
When completing the application, the applicant should provide the name of each joint 
author who contributed copyrightable  authorship to the joint work. The Office takes the 
position that each joint author must contribute a sufficient amount of original 
authorship to the work. An author who satisfies this requirement may be considered a 
joint author, even if his or her contri bution to the work is smaller or less significant than 
the contributions made by another author. By contrast, a collaborator who merely 
contributes a de minimis  amount of expression is not considered a joint author . See  
Chapter 300 , Section 313.4(B).  
As a general rule, the registration specialist  will accept the applicant’s representation 
that a work of authorship is a joint work, unless it is contradicted by information 
provided elsewhere in the registration materials or in the Office’s records, or by 
information that is known to the specialist. I f the claim  appears implausible, the 
specialist may communicate with the applicant or may refuse registration. Examples of 
factors that may indicate that a work does not qualify as a joint work i nclude the 
following:  
• Evidence that one or more of the authors did not intend to merge their 
contributions into a unitary whole.  
• A work containing a number of separate and independent works, such as a book of 
photographs by different authors.  
• A work contai ning a major contribution from one author combined with a minor 
contribution by another author, such as a book containing hundreds of pages of text 
by one author and an introduction or a few illustrations by another author.  
 505.3  The Scope of the Copyrigh t in a Joint Work  
Determining whether a work of authorship is a joint work  has important implications 
for the ownership of the copyright and the term of the copyright.  
The authors of a joint wo rk jointly own the copyright in each other’s contributions and 
each author owns an undivided interest in the copyright for the work as a whole. 17 
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  17 01/28/2021  U.S.C. § 201(a) . In other words, all t he authors are “treated generally as tenants in 
common, with each co -owner having an independent right to use or license the use of a 
work, subject to a duty of accounting to the other co -owners for any profits.” H.R.  REP. 
NO. 94-1476,  at 121 , reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5736; S. REP. NO. 94-473,  at 104 .  
If the work of authorship was created by two or more indiv iduals, the copyright in the 
joint work expires seventy years after the death of the last surviving author. 17 U.S.C. § 
302(b) . If the joint work was created by two or more authors as a  work made for hire , an 
anonymous  work, or a pseudonymous  work, the copyr ight expires ninety -five years 
from the year of publication  or 120 years from the year of creation (whichever is 
shorter). 17 U.S.C. § 302(c) . The term “for an anonymous or pseudonymous work can be 
converted to the ordinary life -plus -[seventy] term if ‘the identity of one or more of the 
[joint] authors . . . is revealed’ in . . . records maintained for this purpose in the Copyr ight 
Office.” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476,  at 137 , reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5753; S. REP. NO. 
94-473,  at 120 . In this situation, the term of the copyright is “based on the life of the 
author or co -authors whose identity has been revealed.” 17 U.S.C. § 302(c) . 
 506 Works Made for Hire  
This Section provides the definition and a general discussion concerning works made 
for hire. For guidance in preparing an application to register a work made for hire , see 
Chapter 600 , Sections 613.4, 614.1, 616.1(A), and 617.3.  
 506.1  What Is a Work Made for Hire?  
The term “ work made for hire ” is defined in Section 101  of the Copyright Act. This 
definition applies to works created on or after January 1, 1978. For works created prior 
to 1978, see Chapter 2100 . 
The statute defines a work made for hire as:  
1. A work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment;  
or 
2. A work that is specially ordered or commissioned, provided that the parties 
expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be 
considered a “work made for hire,” and provided that the work is specially ordered 
or commissioned for use as:  
• A contribution to a collective work ; 
• A part of a motion picture  or other audiovisual work ; 
• A translation ; 
• A compilation ; 
• A test;  
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  18 01/28/2021  • Answer material for a test;  
• An atlas;  
• An instructional  text, which is defined as a “literary, pictorial, or graphic work 
prepared for publication  and with the purpose of use in systematic instructional 
activities;” or  
• A supplementary work, which is defined as “a work prepared for publication  as 
a secondary adjunct to a work by another author for the purpose of introducing, 
concluding, illustrating, explaining , revising, commenting upon, or assisting in 
the use of the other work, such as forewords, afterwords, pictorial illustrations, 
maps, charts, tables, editorial notes, musical arrangements, answer material for 
tests, bibliographies, appendixes, and indexes. ”  
17 U.S.C. § 101  (definition of “work made for hire”).  
 506.2  Works Created by an Employee Within the Scope of His or Her Employment  
The Copyright Act does not define the terms “employee,” “employer,” or “scope of 
employment.” The Supreme Court has held that Congress intended these terms “to be 
understood in light of agency law” and that the courts should rely “on the general 
common law  of agency, rather than on the law of any particular State, to give meaning to 
these terms.” Community for Creative Non -Violence v. Reid , 490 U.S. 730, 740 (1989). 
Examples of factors that may be relevant to this inquiry include the following (although 
none of these factors is determinative):  
• The skill required to create the work.  
• The location where the work was created.  
• The source of the instrumentalities and tools used to create the work.  
• The duration of the relationship between the parties.  
• Whether the h iring party has the right to assign additional projects to the hired 
party.  
• The method of payment.  
• The extent of the hired party’s discretion over when and how long to work.  
• The hired party’s role in hiring and paying assistants.  
• Whether the hiring par ty is in business.  
• Whether the work is part of the regular business of the hiring party.  
• Whether the hiring party provided employee benefits to the hired party.  
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  19 01/28/2021  • The tax treatment of the hired party.  
• Whether the work is the type of work the hired party w as authorized to perform.  
• Whether the work occurs substantially within the authorized work hours and space 
limits of the hired party.  
• Whether the work is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the hiring party.  
See id.  at 751 -52 (citing Restatem ent (Second) of Agency § 220(2) (1958)); U.S. Auto 
Parts Network, Inc. v. Parts Geek, LLC , 692 F. 3d 1009, 1015 (9th Cir. 2012).  
The following examples illustrate some of the factors that may indicate whether a work 
does or does not qualify as a work made for hire . 
Work created by an employee  
• Dave Muller is a full time chemist for Continental Chemicals. Dave created a 
computer program  that evaluates the company’s products. By eliminating the need 
to perform mathematical calculations by hand, the program improved the efficiency 
of the company’s operations. Continental subsequently asked Dave to develop 
similar programs for its other produ cts. Dave wrote and tested these programs at 
home using his personal computer. He did not receive overtime or any additional 
pay for creating these programs. Each program is considered a work made for hire. 
Although Dave was not hired as a computer program mer, he was employed by 
Continental when he wrote these programs and he wrote the programs, at least in 
part, to further the company’s interests. Developing these programs was incidental 
to his responsibilities because they improved the quality control of the company’s 
operations. Dave specifically created the programs for the company’s products and 
it is unlikely that he would do this type of work on his own. In the application to 
register the program, Continental Chemicals should be named as the author an d the 
work made for hire box should be checked “yes.”  
Work created by an employee acting within the scope of his or her employment  
• Lois Lang has worked part time for the Georgetown Gazette  for five years. She is 
expected to write at least five articles per  week and she does most of her work at the 
paper’s office. She is paid on a monthly basis and income taxes, social security, and 
medicare are withheld from her paycheck. The Gazette  reimburses Lois for her 
driving expenses, but she receives no direct emplo yee benefits. Lois’s contributions 
to the paper are considered works made for hire. In the application to register Lois’s 
contributions, the publisher of the Georgetown Gazette  should be named as the 
author and the work made for hire box should be checked “yes.”  
• Kir Royale Records is in the business of producing classical music recordings. Stefan 
Brooks is a sound engineer who works for Kir Royale from time to time. Stefan 
performs all of his work at the company’s studio using the company’s sound mixing 
equipment. His supervisor closely monitors his job performance and evaluates the 
quality of his work. Stefan is paid an hourly wage and he receives no employee

Chapter 500   :  20 01/28/2021  benefits. The recordings that he produces for Kir Royale Records are considered 
works made for hire . In the application to register these sound recordings , Kir 
Royale Records should be named as the author of the recordings and the work made 
for hire box should be checked “yes.”  
• Jack Thomas is a full time programmer for Creative Computer Corporation. His job 
responsibilities include writing source code, designing user interfaces, and 
preparing program documentation. Jack creates a subroutine for a new program 
called Utopolis. The routi ne is considered a work made for hire, because Jack 
created this work while acting within the scope of his duties as an employee of 
Creative Computer Corporation. In the application to register Utopolis, Creative 
Computer Corporation should be named as the  author and the work made for hire 
box should be checked “yes.”  
Work created by an individual who was not acting within the scope of his or her 
employment   
• John Bellevue is a staff composer for SoundTrax, Inc., a company that produces 
music for motion pict ure studios. While on a leave of absence, John wrote a song 
called “Saturdays Are the Best” to celebrate his son’s birthday. Although John is a 
fulltime employee of SoundTrax, he did not create this song as part of his regular 
duties. Therefore, the song i s not a work made for hire. In the application to register 
“Saturdays Are the Best,” John should be named as the author of the song and the 
work made for hire box should be checked “no.”  
• Ryan Jennings created a compilation of pharmaceutical statistics whil e in graduate 
school. When he graduated, Ryan formed Prescription Financial LLP, assigned the 
copyright in this compilation to the company, and appointed himself President and 
CEO. The compilation is not a work made for hire, because Ryan was not an 
employ ee of Prescription Financial when he created this work. In the application to 
register the index, Ryan should be named as the author and the work made for hire 
box should be checked “no.”  
Work created by an individual who is not an employee   
• WMFH -FM asked Aaron Washington to create a jingle for the station. The station 
told Aaron that the jingle should be thirty seconds long and that it should include 
the sound of a helicopter. Aaron wrote the jingle at home using his own equipment 
and he did most of his wo rk in the middle of the night. Aaron was paid a flat fee for 
this assignment. The jingle is not a work made for hire because Aaron was not an 
employee of WMFH. In the application to register this jingle, Aaron should be named 
as the author and the work mad e for hire box should be checked “no.”  
• Julianne Ziegler prepared the first draft for a screenplay titled “Princesses vs. 
Zombies.” After completing the first draft, Zombieflix LLC asked Julianne to prepare 
a shooting script based on her screenplay. The fir st draft of this screenplay is not a 
work made for hire, because Julianne completed the draft before she was hired by 
Zombieflix LLC. In the application to register the first draft, Julianne should be 
named as the author and the work made for hire box shou ld be checked “no.”

Chapter 500   :  21 01/28/2021  • Marilyn Chariott works for an accounting firm. She wrote a song titled “Buy the 
Numbers” in her spare time and someday she hopes to be hired as a 
singer/songwriter. Marilyn’s song is not a work made for hire, because she did not 
write t his song for her current employer. In the application to register “Buy the 
Numbers,” Marilyn should be named as the author and the work made for hire box 
should be checked “no.”  
 506.3  Works Specially Ordered or Commissioned as a Work Made for Hire  
A speci ally ordered or commissioned work is considered a work made for hire if it 
satisfies the following criteria:  
• The work must fall within one or more of the nine categories of works listed in the 
statutory definition.  
• There must be an express written agreemen t between the party that ordered or 
commissioned the work and the individual(s) that actually created the work.  
• The agreement must state that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.  
• The agreement must be signed by both parties.  
If a work fails t o satisfy all of these requirements, it does not qualify as a work made 
for hire.  
The following examples illustrate some of the factors that may indicate whether a work 
does or does not qualify as a work made for hire under the second part of the statutory  
definition.  
Works specially ordered or commissioned pursuant to a written agreement specifying that 
the work will be created as a work made for hire  
• Lighthouse Books Inc. is the author of a textbook. The company hired Nous 
Traduisons Inc. to translate thi s work from English into French. Before Nous 
Traduisons began working on this project, the parties signed a written agreement 
stating that Nous Traduisons would translate the textbook for Lighthouse Books as a 
work made for hire. The work satisfies the sec ond part of the statutory definition, 
because a translation is one of the nine categories of works that may be specially 
ordered or commissioned and because the parties signed a written agreement 
specifying that the work would be created for Lighthouse Boo ks as a work made for 
hire. In the application to register this work, Lighthouse Books, Inc. should be 
named as the author of the translation and the work made for hire box should be 
checked “yes.”  
No written agreement between the parties specifying that t he work will be created as a 
work made for hire  
• Judy Smith works for a car dealership. During her lunch break, she created an atlas 
that depicts the cities and territories in an imaginary country. She hopes to sell her

Chapter 500   :  22 01/28/2021  work to a company that publishes fant asy books. Judy’s atlas fails the first part of 
the statutory definition because she did not create this work for her employer while 
acting within the scope of her employment. Although an atlas is one of the nine 
categories of works that may be created as a work made for hire, Judy’s atlas does 
not satisfy the second part of the statutory definition because she has not signed a 
written agreement specifying that she would create this atlas for another party as a 
work made for hire. In the application to regi ster this atlas, Judy should be named as 
the author and the work made for hire box should be checked “no.”  
Work does not fall within the nine categories of works listed in the statutory definition that 
may be specially ordered or commissioned as a work mad e for hire   
• Monkey Business Inc. hired Heath Liszewski to create the design for a new line of 
wallpaper. The work does not satisfy the first part of the statutory definition 
because Heath is an independent contractor and he was paid a flat fee for his work  
on this assignment. Therefore, he is not an employee of Monkey Business. Although 
the parties signed a written agreement specifying that Heath would create this work 
for Monkey Business, it does not satisfy the second part of the definition because 
two-dimensional artwork is not one of the nine categories of works that may be 
specially ordered or commissioned as a work made for hire. In the application to 
register this work, Heath should be named as the author and the work made for hire 
box should be check ed “no.”  
 506.4  Determining whether the Work is a Work Made for Hire  
 506.4(A)  Applicant Makes the Determination  
The applicant —not the U.S. Copyright Office —must determine whether the work is a 
work is made for hire, and this determination should be based  on the facts that exist at 
the time when the work was created.  
When examining a work made for hire  the Office applies U.S. copyright law, even if the 
work was created in a foreign country, crea ted by a citizen, domiciliary, or habitual 
resident of a foreign country, or first published  in a foreign country. The U.S. Copyright 
Act is the exclusive source of copyright protection in the United States, and all 
applicants —both foreign and domestic —mus t demonstrate that a work satisfies the 
requirements of U.S. copyright law in order to register a work with the Office.  
As a general rule, the registration specialist  will accept the applicant’s representation 
that a work is a work made for hire, unless it is contradicted by information provided 
elsewhere in the registration materials or in the Office’s records or by information that 
is known to the specialist. If the claim  appears unusual or implausible, the specialist may 
communicate with the applicant or may refuse registratio n.  
 506.4(B)  Work Made for Hire Questionnaire  
Upon request, the U.S. Copyright Office will provide the applicant with general 
information about the provisions of the Copyright Act, including the statutory definition 
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  23 01/28/2021  of a work made for hire , and will explain the relevant practices and procedures for 
registering the work.  
The Office cannot provide specific legal advice on the rights of persons, issues involving 
a particular use of a copyrighted wor k, cases of alleged foreign or domestic copyright 
infringement , contracts between authors and publishers, or other matters of a simila r 
nature. 37 C.F.R. § 201.2(a)(3) . However, the Office has developed a questionnaire that 
may be useful to applicants in determining whether a particular work fits within the 
statutory definition of a work made for hire.  
NOTE:  This questionnaire is only intended for use in connection wit h works created on 
or after January 1, 1978.  
Question 1: Was the work created by an employee?  
NOTE:  The fact that someone was hired or paid to create a work does not necessarily 
mean that that person is an employee. For guidance on whether a person may be  
considered an employee, see Section 506.2 . 
If the answer to Question 1 is “yes,” proceed to Question 2. If the answer is “no,” 
proceed to Question 3.  
Question 2:  Did the employee create the work while acting within the scope of hi s or her 
employment?  
If the answer to Question 2 is “yes,” the work is a work made for hire. For guidance 
in completing an application to register a work made for hire, see Chapter 600 , 
Section 614.1.  
If the answer is “no,” proceed to Question 3.  
Question 3: Is there a written agreement between the party that ordered or 
commissioned the work and the party who created the work?  
If the answer is “no,” the work is not a work ma de for hire.  
If the answer is “yes,” proceed to Question 4.  
Question 4:  Was the written agreement signed by the party that ordered or 
commissioned the work and the party who created the work?  
If the answer is “no,” the work is not a work made for hire.  
If the answer is “yes,” proceed to Question 5.  
Question 5:  Did the parties expressly agree in the written agreement that the work shall 
be considered a work made for hire?  
If the answer is “no,” the work is not a work made for hire.

Chapter 500   :  24 01/28/2021  If the answer is “yes,” pr oceed to Question 6.  
Question 6:  Was the work specially ordered or commissioned for use in one or more of 
the following types of works?  
• An atlas.  
• A test.  
• Answer material for a test.  
• A translat ion.  
• As part of a motion picture  or other audiovisual work .  
• A compilation .  
• A contribution to a collective work .  
• A supplementary work.  
• An instructional text.  
If the answer is “no,” the work is no t a work made for hire.  
If the answer is “yes,” the work is a work made for hire. For guidance in completing 
an application to register a work made for hire, see Chapter 600 , Section 614.1.  
 506.5  The Scope of the Copyright in a Work Made for Hire  
Determining whether a work is a work made for hire  has important implications for the 
term of the copyright, the owners hip of the copyright, and the ability to terminate a 
transfer  or license  involving the copyright. See Community for Creative Non -Viole nce v. 
Reid , 490 U.S. 730, 737 (1989) (“Classifying a work as ‘made for hire’ determines not 
only the initial ownership of its copyright, but also the copyright’s duration . . . [and] 
termination rights.”). Therefore, the U.S. Copyright Office encourages a pplicants to 
exercise judgment when answering the work made for hire portion of the application.  
• Copyright Term.  The copyright in a work made for hire expires ninety -five years 
from the year of publication  or one hundred twenty years from the year of creation 
(whichever is shorter). 17 U.S.C. § 302(c) .  
• Copyright Ownership . The copyright in a work made for hire initially belongs to the 
employer or the party that ordered or commissioned the work (rather than the 
individual who actually created the work). In other words, if the work was created 
by an employee acting within th e scope of his or her employment, the employer 
owns the copyright in that work (not the employee). If the work was specially 
ordered or commissioned as a work made for hire, the person or organization that 
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  25 01/28/2021  ordered or commissioned owns the copyright in that  work (rather than the 
individual who actually created the work). 17 U.S.C. § 201(b) .  
• Termination.  Under certain circumstances, an author or his or her heirs may 
terminate an exclusive  or nonexclusive transfer or license of the copyright in the 
author’s work by exercising the author’s right to terminate a grant under Sections 
203, 304(c) , and 304(d)  of the Copyright Act. However, these termination provisions 
do not apply to grants involving the copyright in a work made for hire.  For a general 
discussion of termination, see Chapter 2300 , Section 2310.  
 507 Derivative Works  
This Section provides the definition and a general discussion concerning derivative 
works . For information concerning the Office’s practices and procedures for evaluating 
the copyrightability of derivative works, see Chapter 300 , Section 311. For guidance in 
completing an application to register a derivative work, see Chapter 600 , Sections 613.6, 
617.5, 618.5, 620. 7, and 621.  
 507.1  What Is a Derivative Work?  
The Copyright Act defines a derivative work  as “a work based upon one or more 
preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramati zation, 
fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgement, 
condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or 
adapted.” The statute also states that “[a] work consisting of editorial revisi ons, 
annotations, elaborations, or other modifications, which, as a whole, represent an 
original work of authorship, is a ‘derivative work.’” 17 U.S.C. § 101 . 
Creating a derivative work  requires “a process of recasting, transforming, or adapting 
‘one or more preexisting works.’” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476  at 57 , reprinted in  1976 
U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5670; S. REP. NO. 94-473  at 55 . Thus, derivative works contain two 
distinct forms of authorship:  
• The authorship in the preexisting work(s) that has been recast, transformed, or 
adapted w ithin the derivative wor k, and  
• The new authorship involved in recasting, transforming, or adapting the preexisting 
work(s).  
The new authorship that the author contributed to the derivative work may be 
registered, provided that it contains a sufficient amount of original authors hip. 
As the legislative history explains, derivative works include “every copyrightable work 
that employs preexisting material . . . of any kind,” regardless of whether the preexisting 
material is protected by copyright or whether the copyright in that mat erial has expired. 
H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476  at 57 , reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5670; S. REP. NO. 94-473  at 
55. Typically, a derivative work is a new version of a preexisting work or a work that is 
based on or derived from a preexisting work.  
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  26 01/28/2021  Examples:  
• A motion picture based on a novel or a play.  
• An English translation of a novel written i n Spanish.  
• A sculpture based on a drawing.  
• A drawing based on a photograph.  
• A lithograph based on a painting.  
• A musical arrangement of a preexisting musical work.  
• A drama based on the letters and sermons of Cotton Mather.  
A new edition of a preexisting work may also qualify as a derivative work, provided that 
the revisions or other modifications, taken as a whole, constitute a new work of 
authorship.  
Examples:   
• A revision of a previously published book.  
• A revision of the artwork and text on a  website.  
• A new version of an existing computer program.  
• A new version of a doll or stuffed animal.  
 507.2  The Scope of the Copyright in a Derivative Work  
The copyright for a derivative work  only  covers the new material that the author 
contributed to that work. It does not cover any of the preexisting material that appears 
in the derivative work. See H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476,  at 57, reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 
5670 ; S. REP. NO. 94-473, at 55  (“[C]opyright in a ‘new version’ covers only the material 
added by the later author, and has no effect one way or th e other on the copyright or 
public domain status of the preexisting material.”). Likewise, a registration for a 
derivative work does not cover any previously published  material, previously registered 
material, public domain material, or third party materia l that appears in the work. In 
other words, the copyright in a derivative work is “independent of, and does not affect 
or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any copyright protection in 
the preexisting material.” 17 U.S.C. § 103(b) . 
Derivative works often contain previously published material, previously registered 
material, public domain material, or material owned by a third party because by 
definition they are b ased upon one or more preexisting works. If a derivative work 
contains an appreciable amount of unclaimable material, the applicant generally should 
limit the claim  to the new material that the author contributed to the work, and the 
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  27 01/28/2021  unclaimable material  should be excluded from the claim. For guidance on this 
procedure, see Chapter 600 , Section 621.8. By contra st, there is generally no need to 
limit the claim if the derivative work is solely based on or derived from unpublished  
material, unregistered material, or copyrightable  material that is owned by the claimant  
named in the application.  
The author of a derivative work may claim copyright in a work that recasts, transforms, 
or adapts a preexisting work, provided that the preexisting material has been used in a 
lawful manner. Section 103(a)  of the Copyright Act states that the copyright in a 
derivative work “does not extend to any part of the work” that “unlawfully” uses 
preexisting material. 17 U.S.C.  § 103(a) . As discussed in Chapter 300 , Section 313.6(B), 
this provision is intended to prevent “an infringer  from benefiting, through copyright 
protection, from committing an unlawful act.” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476, at 57 , reprinted in  
1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5671 . The unlawful use of preexisting m aterial may also infringe the 
right of reproduction and/or the right to prepare derivative works based upon that 
material.  
 508 Compilations  
This Section provides the definition and a general discussion concerning compilations . 
For information concerning the Office’s practices and procedures for evaluating the 
copyrightability of compilations, see Chapter 300 , Section 312. For guidance in 
preparing an application to register a compilation see Chapter 600 , Sections 613.7, 
617.5, 618.6, 620.7, and 621.8(C).  
 508.1  What Is a Compilat ion?  
The Copyright Act defines a compilation  as “a work formed by the collection and 
assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected, coordinated or arranged 
in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of 
authorship.” 17 U.S.C. § 101 . 
As the legislative history explains, “[a] ‘compilation’ results from a process of selecting, 
bringing together, organizing, and arranging previously existing material of all kinds, 
regardless of whether the individual items in the material have been or ever could have 
been subject to copyright.” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476,  at 57 , reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 
5670; S. REP. NO. 94-473,  at 55 . 
Examples:  
• A directory of services for a particular region.  
• A list of the best short stories of 2014.  
• A collection of the best sound recordings of 1985.  
The statute states that “[t]he term ‘compilation’ includes collective works,” which are 
discussed in more detail in Section 509 below. 17 U.S.C. § 101 . Creating a collective work 
also “involve[s] the selection, assembly, and arrangement of ‘a number of contributions,” 
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  28 01/28/2021  because this type of work “is a species of ‘ compilation.’” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476,  at 122 , 
reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5737; S. REP. NO. 94-473,  at 105 .  
Examples:  
• A book of news photos.  
• An academic journal containing articles on a particular topic.  
• A newspaper comprised of articles by different journalists.  
 508.2  The Scope of the Copyright in a Compilation  
The fact that a compilation  has been registered with the U.S. Copyright Office does not 
necessarily mean that every element of the work is protected by copyright. A claim  to 
copyright in a compilation “e xtends only to the material contributed by the author of 
such work” and does not “imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material.” 17 U.S.C. 
§ 103(b) . The data, facts, or other u ncopyrightable material that appears in a 
compilation is not protected by the copyright in that work. See Feist Publications, Inc . v. 
Rural Telephone Service Co ., 499 U.S. 340, 360 (1991) (stating that “the copyright in a 
compilation does not extend to the  facts it contains”). A registration for a compilation 
does not cover any of the preexisting material or data that appears in the compilation 
unless that material or data is expressly claimed in the registration. Likewise, a 
registration for a compilation does not cover any previously published  material, 
previously registered material, public domain  material, or third party material that 
appears in the compilation. “This inevitably means that the copyright in a factual 
compilation is thin. Notwithstanding a valid copyright, a subsequent compiler remains 
free to use the facts contained in another’s publication to aid in preparing a competing 
work, so long as the competing work does not feature the s ame selection and 
arrangement.” Id. 499 U.S. at 349.  
When registering a compilation, the applicant should identify the preexisting material or 
data that the author selected, coordinated, and/or arranged. If the compilation contains 
an appreciable amount of  previously published material, previously registered material, 
public domain material, or material owned by a third party, the applicant generally 
should limit the claim to the new material that the author contributed to the work and 
the unclaimable mater ial should be excluded from the claim. For guidance on this 
procedure, see Chapter 600 , Section 621.8(E).  
The author of a compilation may claim copyright in an original sel ection, coordination, 
and/or arrangement of preexisting material, provided that the material has been used in 
a lawful manner. Section 103(a)  of the Copyright Act states that the copyri ght in a 
compilation “does not extend to any part of the work” that “unlawfully” uses preexisting 
material. As discussed in Chapter 300 , Section 313.6(B), this provision is intended to 
prevent “an infringer from benefiting, through copyright protection, from committing an 
unlawful act.” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476,  at 57 , reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5671.  
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  29 01/28/2021   509 Collective Works and Contributions to Collective Works  
This Section provides the definition and a general discussion of collective works  and 
contributions to collective works. For information concerning the Office’s practices and 
procedures for evaluating the copyrightability of collective works, see Chapter 300 , 
Section 312. For guidance in preparing an application to register a collective work or a 
contribution to a collective work, see Chapter 600 , Sections 610.4, 613.8, 618.7, 620.8, 
and 621.8(D). For guidance in registering a catalog as a collective work, see Chapter 900, 
Section 915.  
 509.1  What Is a Collective Work?  
A collective work  is a type of compilation . The Copyright Act defines a collective work as 
“a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of 
contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are 
assembled into a collective whole.” 17 U.S.C. § 101 . The statute also states that “[t] he 
term ‘compilation’ includes collective works.” Id. (definition of “compilation”). Thus, 
collective works are subject to the statutory requirements for compilations: There must 
be a sufficiently creative selection, coordination, or arrangement of the com ponent 
works to establish a collective work.  
Creating a collective work requires the “assemblage or gathering of ‘separate and 
independent works . . . into a collective whole.’” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476, at 120 , reprinted 
in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5736; S. REP. NO. 94-473, at 104  (omission in original). In 
other words, collective works contain two distinct forms of authorship:  
• The compilation authorship in creating the collective work, which involves selecting, 
coordinating, and/or arranging a number of separate and independent wo rks and 
assembling them into a collective whole; and  
• The authorship in the separate and independent works included within the 
collective work, such as an article that appears in a periodical issue or a poem that 
appears in an anthology.  
An applicant may re gister a collective work together with the separate and independent 
works contained therein (i) if the copyright in the collective work and the component 
works are owned by the same claimant, and (ii) if the component works have not been 
previously publish ed, previously registered, and are not in the public domain.  
By definition, a collective work must contain “a number of contributions.” A work that 
contains “relatively few separate elements” does not satisfy this requirement, such as a 
work containing a s ingle contribution, a composition that merely consists of words and 
music, a publication  that merely combines a single work with illustrations or front 
matter, or a publication that merely contai ns three one -act plays. H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476,  
at 122 , reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5737; S. REP. NO. 94-473,  at 105 . 
As a general rule, a contribution that is “incorporated in a ‘collective work’ must itself 
constitute a ‘separate and independent’ work .” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476, at 122 , reprinte d in 
1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5737; S. REP. NO. 94-473, at 105 . In other words, a contribution must 
be an original work of authorship that is eligible for copyright protection under  Section 
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  30 01/28/2021  102(a)  of the Copyright Act, regardless of whether that contribution is currently 
protected or whether the copyright in that contribution has expired.  
 509.2  The Scope of the Copyright  in a Collective Work  
The “[c]opyright in each separate contribution to a collective work is distinct from 
copyright in the collective work as a whole.” 17 U.S.C. § 201(c) .  
The “[c]opyright in the separate contribution ‘vests initially in the author of the 
contribution.’” New York Times Co. v. Tasini,  533 U.S. 483, 494 (2001) (quoting 17 U.S.C. 
§ 201(c) ). The “[c]opyright in the collective work vests in the collective author” and it 
“extends only to the creative material contributed by that author, not to ‘the preexisting 
material employed in the work.’” Id. at 494 (quoting 17 U.S.C. § 103(b) ). Specifically, the 
copyright in the collective work “extend[s] to the elements of compilation and editing 
that went into [creating] the collective work as a whole.” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476, at 122 , 
reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5738; S. REP. NO. 94-473, at 106 . In addition, it extends 
to “the contributions tha t were written for hire by employees of the owner of the 
collective work, and those copyrighted contributions that have been transferred in 
writing to the owner by their authors.” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476, at 122 , reprinted in  1976 
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5738; S. REP. NO. 94-473, at 106 . 
An applicant may register a collective work together with the contributions contained 
therei n (i) if the contributions and the collective work were created by the same author, 
or (ii) if the copyright in the contributions and the collective work are owned by the 
same claimant , (iii) pro vided that the contributions and the collective work have not 
been previously published  or previously registered, and provided that they are not in 
the public domain. If the owner of the collective work does not own all rights in the 
copyright for a partic ular contribution, that party cannot register a claim  to copyright in 
that contribution. Instead, the contribution must be registered individually by or on 
behalf of the author of the contribution or the party that owns the copyright in that 
work. See Morris v. Business Concepts, Inc ., 259 F.3d 65, 71 (2d Ci r. 2001) (“Unless the 
copyright owner of a collective work also owns all the rights in a constituent part, a 
collective work registration will not extend to the constituent part.”), abrogated on other 
grounds by Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick , 559 U.S. 15 4, 160 (2010).  
Collective works often contain previously published material, previously registered 
material, public domain  material, or material owned by a third party. If a collective work 
conta ins an appreciable amount of unclaimable material, the applicant generally should 
limit the claim to the new material that the author contributed to the work and the 
unclaimable material should be excluded from the claim. For guidance on this 
procedure, se e Chapter 600 , Section 621.8(D).  
The author of a collective work may claim copyright in an original selection, 
coordination, and/or arrangement of preexisting material, pro vided that the material 
has been used in a lawful manner. Section 103(a)  of the Copyright Act states that the 
copyright in a compilation “does not extend to any part of the work” that “ unlawfully” 
uses preexisting material, and as discussed above, the term “compilation” includes 
collective works. As discussed in Chapter 300 , Section 313.6(B), this provi sion is 
intended to prevent “an infringer from benefiting, through copyright protection, from 
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  31 01/28/2021  committing an unlawful act.” H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476,  at 57 , reprinted in  1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 
at 5671.  
 510 One Registration Per Work  
As a general rule, the U.S. Copyright Office will issue only one basic registration for each 
work. 37 C.F.R. § 202.3(b)(11) ; H.R.  REP. NO. 94-1476,  at 155 , reprinted in  1976 
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 5771; S. REP. NO. 94-473,  at 138  (recognizing that there is a “general rule 
against allowing more than one registration (i.e., basic registration) for the same work”).  
Allowing multiple registrations for the same work confuses the public record. Therefore, 
the Office will not knowingly issue multiple registrations for the sam e version of a 
particular work, and the Office generally will decline to issue additional registrations 
once a basic registration has been made. See Part 202 –Registration of Claims to 
Copyright, 43 Fed. Reg. 965, 965 -66 (Jan. 5, 1978);  Applications for Registration of Claim 
to Copyright Under Revised Copyright Act, 42 Fed. Reg. 48,944, 48,945 (Sept. 26, 1977).  
There are three limited exceptions to this rule, which are discussed in Sections 510.1  
through 510.3 .  
 510.1  Unpublished Works vs. Published Works  
If the U.S. Copyright Office issued a registration for an unpublished  work and if that 
work was published  sometime thereafter, the Office will accept another application to 
register the first pub lished edition of the work (even if the unpublished version and the 
published version are substantially the same). 17 U.S.C. § 408(e) ; 37 C.F.R. § 
202.3(b)(11)(i) .  
When completing the application for the first published edition, the applicant should 
provide the registration number of the unpublished version using the procedure 
described in Chapter 600 , Section 621.8(F). If the application for the first published 
edition is approved, the registration for that edition will exist alongside the registration 
for the unpublished version.  
 510.2  Naming the Author as the Copyright Claimant  
An author may seek a registration naming himself or herself as the  copyright claimant , 
even if the Office previously issued a registration that named a different individual or 
legal entity as the claimant for that work. See 37 C.F.R. § 202.3(b)(11)(ii) . Likewise, a 
joint author may seek a registration naming himself or herself as the c laimant, even if 
the joint work was previously registered by or on behalf of the other authors. See id.  n.2. 
When completing the application, the applicant should provide the registration number 
for the previous registration using the procedure described i n Chapter 600 , Section 
621.8(F).  
In some cases, the author of a collective work  may register that work without 
identifying the authors of the component works contained therein. The author of a 
component work may register that work in his or her own name in this situation, even if 
the Office previously registered the component work together with the collective work 
as a whole.

Chapter 500   :  32 01/28/2021  Allowing an author to register a work in his or her own name is consistent “with the 
fundamental thrust of the [Copyright Act of 1976] in identifying copyright, and the 
origin of all rights comprised in  a copyright, with the author.”  Applications for 
Registration of Claim to Copyright Under Revised Copyright Act, 42 Fed. Reg. 48,944, 
48,946 (Sept. 26, 1977) . This may be useful where the author retains a reversionary 
interest in  a contribution to a collective work and wants “to reflect his or her retained or 
continued legal or beneficial ownership of certain rights” in the copyright after it has 
been transferred to another party. Id. at 48,945.  
This exception does not apply in ca ses where a third party previously registered the 
work and named the author as the copyright claimant.  
This exception does not apply in cases involving a work made for hire. If the Office 
issued a registration that named the employer or other hiring party  as the copyright 
claimant, the individual who actually created the work cannot obtain another 
registration in his or her own name unless the applicant is asserting an adverse claim. 
37 C.F.R . § 202.3(b)(11)(ii) n. 2. For information concerning adverse claims, see Section 
510.3 . 
Likewise, this exception does not apply if the work was registered before January 1, 
1978. If the work was registered before that date and if another party was named as the 
copyright claimant, the Office will not issue another registration naming the autho r as 
the claimant. For more information on this issue, see Chapter 2100 , Section 2130, 2131, 
and 2134.  
 510.3  Adverse Claims  
If the Office issued a registration for a work of authorship and another applicant 
subsequently alleges that the registration is unauthorized or legally invalid, the 
applicant may seek another registration for that same work. 37 C.F.R. § 
202.3(b)(11)(iii) . In this situation, the applicant should prepare a new application using 
the procedure described in Chapter 1800 , Section 1807.  
 511 One Work Per Re gistration  
As a general rule, a registration covers one individual work, and an applicant should 
prepare a separate application, filing fee , and deposit  for each work that is submitted for 
registration. See 17 U.S.C. §§ 408(a) , 409 (authorizing th e U.S. Copyright Office to 
register a single “work”).  
Although the Office generally allows only one work per application, there are some 
limited exceptions to this rule. In the following cases, it may be possible to register 
multiple works with one applic ation, one filing fee, and one set of deposit copy(ies) : 
• A collective work  may be registered together with the separate and independen t 
works contained therein (i) if the copyright in the collective work and the 
component works are owned by the same claimant, and (ii) if the component works 
have not been previously published, previously registered, and are not in the public 
domain. This option is discussed in Section 509.1  and Chapter 600 , Sections 610.4, 
613.8, 618.7, 620.8, and 621.8(D).

Chapter 500   :  33 01/28/2021  • A number of published  works may be register ed using the unit of publication  option, 
which is discussed in Chapter 1100 , Section 1103.  
• A sound recording  may be registered together with a literary work , musical work, or 
dramatic work, provided that (i) the sound recording a nd the recorded literary 
work, musical work, or dramatic work are embodied in the same phonorecord , (ii) 
the claimant  for both works i s the same person or organization, (iii) the applicant 
selects Sound Recording from the Type of Work field when completing an online 
application or uses Form SR  when completing a paper applicatio n, and (iv) the 
applicant submits a phonorecord that contains both the sound recording and the 
recorded literary work, musical work, or dramatic work.  
• A group of related works may be registered using a group registration  option. The 
Office currently offers group registration options for the following types of works:  
• Unpublished works . 
• Serials  
• Newspapers  
• Newsletters  
• Short online literary works  
• Contributions to periodicals  
• Published photographs  
• Unpublished photographs  
• Database  updates  
• Questions, answers, and other test items that have been prepared for use in a 
secure test .  
For information concerning these group registration options, see Chapter 1100 , Sections 
1105 through 1114.  
 512 Multiple Versions of the Same Work  
The Copyright Act  states that “a work is ‘created’ when it is fixed in a copy or 
phonorecord for the first time.” 17 U.S.C. § 101  (definition of “created”). The statute 
states that “where a work is prep ared over a period of time, the portion of [the work] 
that has been fixed at any particular time constitutes the work as of that time.” Id. It also 
states that “where the work has been prepared in different versions, each version 
constitutes a separate wor k.” Id.

Chapter 500   :  34 01/28/2021  The copyright law protects each version of a work from the moment it is fixed in a copy 
or phonorecord, provided that the author contributed a sufficient amount of original 
expression to that version. 17 U.S.C. § 102(a) . For example, copyright protects each draft 
of a literary work  from the moment it is writte n on paper, saved in a data file, or 
inscribed in any other medium of expression. Likewise, it protects each take of a motion 
picture  from the moment it is captured on film, videotape, or any oth er audiovisual 
medium.  
Although the copyright law generally protects each version of a work, it may not be 
necessary to register each version with the U.S. Copyright Office, depending on whether 
the work is published  or unpublished . These issues are discussed in Sections 512.1  and 
512.2  below.  
 512.1  Unpublished Versions of the Same Work  
If the work is unpublished , there is generally no need to register each version of that 
work. In most cases, the applicant may submit the most recent or the most complete 
version.  
For example, if the author prepared multiple drafts for an unpublished sc reenplay, a 
registration for the most recent version will cover all of the copyrightable  material that 
appears in the deposit copy , including any unpublished expression that has been 
incorporated from prior versions of the same work. Likewise, if the applicant intends to 
register an unpublished website that has been updated, modified, or revised from time 
to time, the registration will  cover all of the copyrightable material that is submitted for 
registration, including any unpublished text, photographs, or other content that has 
been incorporated from prior iterations of the same website.  
If the deposit copy contains copyrightable mate rial that appeared in previous versions 
of the same work there is generally no need to exclude that preexisting material from 
the application unless that material has been previously published  or previously 
registered or unless that material is in the public domain  or is owned by a third party.  
 512.2  Published Versions of the Same Work  
If the versions have been published , the applicant generally should submit a separate 
application, a separate filing fee , and a separate set of deposit copies  for each version.  
For example, if the author published multiple editions of a textboo k, the applicant 
should submit a separate application for each edition. In each case, the registration will 
cover the new material that the author contributed to each edition, including any 
copyr ightable  changes, revisions, additions, or other modifications that appear in the 
deposit copies for that edition. Likewise, if the applicant intends to register a published 
website that has been updated, modified, or revised from time to time, the applica nt 
should prepare a separate application for each version of that site. In each case, the 
registration will cover the text, photographs, or other copyrightable content that 
appeared on the website on the date specified in the application and the deposit co pies.  
The Office will register multiple versions of a published work, provided that each 
version contains a sufficient amount of copyrightable authorship that does not appear in 
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  35 01/28/2021  the other versions. When submitting multiple versions of a published work for  
registration, the applicant should notify the Office by providing the title for each version, 
and if possible, the case number / service request number that has been assigned to 
each claim . In a ddition, the applicant should confirm in writing that the version specified 
in the application contains copyrightable authorship that does not appear in other 
versions. When filing an online application this information should be provided in the 
Note to Co pyright Office field. When filing a paper application this information should be 
provided in a cover letter. This improves the efficiency of the examination process and 
produces more consistent registration decisions.  
The applicant —not the U.S. Copyright Office —should identify the specific version or 
versions that the applicant intends to register. In making this determination, it may be 
helpful to consider the following questions:  
• Does one version contain all of the copyrightable material that appears in the other 
versions of the same work?  
• Were the versions published on the same date or on different dates?  
These topics are discussed in Sections 512.2(A)  through 512.2(C)  below.  
 512.2(A)  Registering Multi ple Versions of a Published Work: More Complete  
Version Published First  
If one version contains all the copyrightable  material that appears in other versions of 
the same work and if that versio n was published  first, the applicant should submit the 
most complete version. In this situation, the applicant should not submit an application 
to register other versions of the same work.  
Example:  
• The Elmwood Avenue Press published two versions of an 
elementary school textbook. The teacher’s edition contains all the 
text and artwork that appears in the student’s edition, plus 
additional instructions, questions, answers, and commentary. The 
teacher’s edition was published on January 22, 2010 and the 
student’s edition was published on February 1, 2010. The publisher 
may register the teacher’s edition, but should not submit an 
application for the student’s edition.  
 512.2(B)  Registering Multiple Versions of a Published Work: Less Complete  
Version Publishe d First  
If one version contains some —but not all —of the copyrightable  material that appears in 
other versions of the same work and if that version was published  first, the applicant 
may register  any or all of those versions. When completing the application for the more 
complete version(s) the applicant should exclude any material that appeared in the 
previously published versions of the same work using the procedure described in 
Chapter 600 , Section 621.8.  
C O M P E N D I U M  O F  U .S. C O P Y R I G H T  O F F I C E  P R A C T I C E S , Third Edition  
Chapter 500   :  36 01/28/2021   Example:  
• The Block Island Press published a calendar on June 1, 2011 that 
contains a number of photographs. On June 15, 2011, the company 
published a coffee tabl e book containing the same photographs and 
some additional sketches. The publisher may submit a separate 
application for the calendar and the book. When completing the 
application for the calendar, the publisher should assert a claim  in 
the photographs. When completing an application for the book, the 
publisher should assert a claim in the artwork, and should exclude 
the previously published photographs from the claim.  
 512.2(C)  Registering Multip le Versions of a Published Work: Multiple Versions 
Published on the Same Date  
If one version contains all the copyrightable  material that appears in other versions of 
the same work and if all the  versions were published  on the same date, the applicant 
should submit the most complete version.  
Example:  
• Dice Drugs published two versions of a user manual on August 15, 
2012. One version is written in English; the other version contains 
the same text wr itten in English and Spanish. The publisher should 
submit an application to register the English/Spanish version.  
If each version contains copyrightable material that does not appear in other versions of 
the same work and if all the versions were published  on the same date, the applicant 
may submit a separate application for each version.  
Example:  
• On September 15, 2013 Coffee Cabinet LLC submits two 
applications for two versions of a novel which were published on 
September 1, 2013. One version is intended f or British readers, 
while the other is an Americanized version that is intended for 
readers in the United States. In both cases, the applicant asserts a 
claim  in text. The registration specialist  will register both claims.  
NOTE:  When all of the versions are published on the same date there is no need to 
exclude any overlapping material that appears in each version because simultaneously 
published material is not considered previously published material for purposes of 
registratio n.
