        <h1>Glossary</h1>
        <p>This Glossary provides brief definitions for certain terms as they apply to registration, recordation, and other services provided by the U.S. Copyright Office. Definitions that are taken directly from the Copyright Act, the Office’s regulations, or a Supreme Court decision are enclosed in quotation marks. Definitions that are not enclosed in quotation marks are not legal definitions; they are intended to educate and inform legal practitioners and members of the public who file applications, record documents, and conduct other business with the Office.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt id="num">1909 Copyright Act:</dt>
            <dd>An Act to Amend and Consolidate the Acts Respecting Copyright, Pub. L. No. 60-349, 35 Stat. 1075 (1909). This law as amended was the copyright law of the United States from July 1, 1909 through December 31, 1977. It was repealed effective January 1, 1978 and replaced with the 1976 Copyright Act.</dd>

            <dt>1976 Copyright Act:</dt>
            <dd>Pub. L. No. 94-553, 90 Stat. 2541 (1976). Passed by Congress and effective on January 1, 1978, this law as amended is the current Copyright Law of the United States. It is codified in Title 17 of the U.S. Code.</dd>

            <dt id="A">Abridgement:</dt>
            <dd>A shortened or condensed version of a preexisting work that retains the general sense and unity of the preexisting work.</dd>

            <dt>Act:</dt>
            <dd>See “1976 Copyright Act.”</dd>

            <dt>Annotation:</dt>
            <dd>A statement that the U.S. Copyright Office adds to the registration record to clarify the facts underlying the claim or to identify legal limitations on the claim. To “annotate” means to add an annotation to the record.</dd>

            <dt>Anonymous work:</dt>
            <dd>“An ‘anonymous work’ is a work on the copies or phonorecords of which no natural person is identified as author.” 17 U.S.C. § 101.</dd>

            <dt>Appeal:</dt>
            <dd>See “Request for reconsideration.”</dd>

            <dt>Applicant:</dt>
            <dd>The party who submits an application to the U.S. Copyright Office.</dd>

            <dt>Applied art:</dt>
            <dd>“Applied art” is “Art employed in the decoration, design, or execution of useful objects, or those arts or crafts that have a primarily utilitarian function, or the designs and decorations used in these arts.” Star Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1002, 1014 (2017) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</dd>

            <dt>Architectural work:</dt>
            <dd>“An ‘architectural work’ is the design of a building as embodied in any tangible medium of expression, including a building, architectural plans, or drawings. The work includes the overall form as well as the arrangement and composition of spaces and elements in the design, but does not include individual standard features.” 17 U.S.C. § 101. The U.S. Copyright Office registers as architectural works designs for structures that can be inhabited by humans or are otherwise intended for human occupancy. Examples include houses, office buildings, churches, museums, gazebos, and garden pavilions.</dd>

            <dt>Audiovisual work:</dt>
            <dd>“‘Audiovisual works’ are works that consist of a series of related images which are intrinsically intended to be shown by the use of machines or devices such as projectors, viewers, or electronic equipment, together with accompanying sounds, if any, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as films or tapes, in which the works are embodied.” 17 U.S.C. § 101. In other words, the term “audiovisual works” refers broadly to any work that includes any series of related visual images, whether or not moving, and with or without sounds, as long as a machine or device is essential to the viewing of the related series of images.</dd>

            <dt>Authorized agent:</dt>

            <dt>Authorship statement:</dt>
            <dd>The portion of the application that describes the copyrightable material created by the author named in the application. In the online application, this portion of this statement typically appears in the Author Created field and/or New Material Included field. In the paper application it typically appears in the Nature of Authorship space and/or the Material Added to This Work space.</dd>

            <dt>Automated database:</dt>
            <dd>See “Database.”</dd>

            <dt id="B">Basic registration:</dt>
            <dd>A registration issued on or after January 1, 1978.</dd>

            <dt>Berne Convention:</dt>
            <dd>An international treaty, the “Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,” to protect literary and artistic works signed at Berne, Switzerland, on September 9, 1886, and all acts, protocols, and revisions thereto. The United States acceded to the Berne Convention and became a member on March 1, 1989.</dd>

            <dt>Best edition:</dt>
            <dd>“The ‘best edition’ of a work is the edition, published in the United States at any time before the date of deposit, that the Library of Congress determines to be most suitable for its purposes.” 17 U.S.C. § 101.</dd>

            <dt>Board:</dt>
            <dd>See “Review Board.”</dd>

            <dt id="C">CAD:</dt>
            <dd>An abbreviation for the U.S. Copyright Office’s “Copyright Acquisitions Division.”</dd>

            <dt>Certificate of registration:</dt>
            <dd>An official record issued by the U.S. Copyright Office that bears the U.S. Copyright Office seal and the signature of the Register of Copyrights. The certificate denotes the fact that the Office has received a valid claim to copyright (i.e., an acceptable application, deposit, and filing fee) and that the claim has been registered by the Office. The certificate shows the registration number and date that the registration is effective. Provided the claim is registered before the work is published or within five years of the date on which the work is first published, the facts on a certificate of registration and the validity of the copyright are presumed true by courts of law unless later shown to be false.</dd>

            <dt>Certification:</dt>
            <dd>1) The act of signing an application to register a work with the U.S. Copyright Office. The individual who signs the application certifies that the information provided therein is correct to the best of his or her knowledge. 2) The preparation of a statement under the seal of the U.S. Copyright Office attesting to the authenticity of a record or report based on a search of the Office’s records; a type of copyright service available for a fee. For certifications provided in connection with the recordation of a transfer of copyright ownership or other documents pertaining to copyright, see “Sworn certification” and “Official certification.”</dd>

            <dt>Choreographic works:</dt>
            <dd>The term “choreography” is derived from the Greek words “choreia,” meaning “dance,” and “graphikos,” meaning “to write.” A dance is a static and kinetic succession of bodily movements in certain rhythmic and spatial relationships and in relation to time and space. Choreography is the composition and arrangement of a related series of dance movements and patterns organized into a coherent whole. Choreography is not synonymous with dance. It is a discrete subset of dance that encompasses certain types of compositional dances. For example, the legislative history for the 1976 Copyright Act states that “‘choreographic works’ do not include social dance steps and simple routines.” See H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 54 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5667; S. REP. NO. 94-473, at 52 (1975).</dd>

            <dt>Claim:</dt>
            <dd>An assertion of ownership of the copyright in a work of authorship. A request to register a work of authorship with the U.S. Copyright Office.</dd>

            <dt>Claimant:</dt>
            <dd>For purposes of copyright registration, the claimant is either the author of the work that has been submitted for registration, or a person or organization that owns all of the rights under copyright that initially belonged to the author of that work.</dd>

            <dt>Collective work:</dt>
            <dd>“A ‘collective work’ is a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology, or encyclopedia, in which a number of contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole.” 17 U.S.C. § 101. A collective work is a form of compilation.</dd>

            <dt>Compilation:</dt>
            <dd>“A ‘compilation’ is a work formed by the collection and assembling of preexisting materials or of data that are selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship. The term ‘compilation’ includes collective works.” 17 U.S.C. § 101.</dd>

            <dt>Compulsory license:</dt>
            <dd>See “Statutory license.”</dd>

            <dt>Computer:</dt>
            <dd>A programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data that is input by a user through a user interface, and is capable of providing output through a display screen or other external output device, such as a printer. “Computers” include mainframes, desktops, laptops, tablets, and smart phones.</dd>

            <dt>Computer program:</dt>
            <dd>“A ‘computer program’ is a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result.” 17 U.S.C. § 101.</dd>

            <dt>Copies:</dt>
            <dd>“‘Copies’ are material objects, other than phonorecords, in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. The term ‘copies’ includes the material object, other than a phonorecord, in which the work is first fixed.” 17 U.S.C. § 101. “The reference to ‘copies and phonorecords,’ although in the plural, are intended . . . to include the singular.” See H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 61 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5675.</dd>

                <li>The copyright symbol © (or for phonorecords, the symbol ℗), the word “Copyright”, or the abbreviation “Copr.”;</li>
                <li>The year of first publication of the work; and</li>
                <li>The name of the copyright owner.</li>
            </ul>
            A copyright notice is no longer legally required to secure copyright on works first published on or after March 1, 1989, although it does provide legal benefits.</dd>

            <dt>Copyrightable:</dt>
            <dd>A term used to describe a work that is original and sufficiently creative to be registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.</dd>

            <dt>Created:</dt>
            <dd>“A work is ‘created’ when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first time; where a work is prepared over a period of time, the portion of it that has been fixed at any particular time constitutes the work as of that time, and where the work has been prepared in different versions, each version constitutes a separate work.” 17 U.S.C. § 101.</dd>

            <dt id="D">Database:</dt>
            <dd>For purposes of copyright registration, a database is defined as a compilation of digital information comprised of data, information, abstracts, images, maps, music, sound recordings, video, other digitized material, or references to a particular subject or subjects. In all cases, the content of a database must be arranged in a systematic manner and it must be accessed by means of an integrated information retrieval program or system with the following characteristics: (i) a query function must be used to access the content; and (ii) the information retrieval program or system must yield a subset of the content or it must organize the content based on the parameters specified in each query.</dd>

            <dt>Date of recordation:</dt>
            <dd>1) For the recordation of transfers of copyright ownership and other documents pertaining to copyright under Section 205 of Title 17 of the United States Code, “[t]he date of recordation is the date when a proper document under [37 C.F.R. § 201.4(c)] and a proper fee under paragraph (d) of this section [37 C.F.R. § 201.4] are all received in the Copyright Office.” 37 C.F.R. § 201.4(e). 2) For the recordation of a notice of termination under Sections 203, 304(c), or 304(d) of Title 17 of the United States Code, “[t]he date of recordation is the date when all of the elements required for recordation, including the prescribed fee and, if required, the statement referred to in [37 C.F.R. § 201.10(f)(1)(ii)], have been received in the Copyright Office.” 37 C.F.R. § 201.10(f)(3). 3) For the recordation of a Visual Arts Registry Statement “[t]he date of recordation is the date when all of the elements required for recordation, including the prescribed fee, have been received in the Copyright Office.” 37 C.F.R. § 201.26(e).</dd>

            <dt>De minimis:</dt>
            <dd>A legal term that is based on the Latin phrase “de minimis non curat lex,” which means “the law does not take notice of very small or trifling matters.” Creative authorship is deemed “de minimis” when a work does not contain the minimal degree of original, creative expression required to satisfy the test for originality in copyright.</dd>

            <dt>Deposit:</dt>
            <dd>See “Deposit copy.”</dd>

            <dd>A physical or electronic embodiment of a work. A deposit copy may be on or in various media (e.g., paper, videotape, online digital code, etc.) and may consist of multiple components. A deposit copy is submitted with an application for registration and must conform to the U.S. Copyright Office’s regulations and other requirements. For copyright registration purposes, the deposit copy should be clear and should contain all of the authorship that the applicant intends to register.</dd>

            <dt>Deposit copies:</dt>
            <dd>The plural form of “deposit copy.”</dd>

            <dt>Deposit copy(ies):</dt>
            <dd>A term meaning “deposit copy” and/or “deposit copies.”</dd>

A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a ‘derivative work.’” 17 U.S.C. § 101.</dd>

            <dt>Design of a useful article:</dt>
            <dd>“The combination of details or features that go to make up the useful article.” 17 U.S.C. § 101 (definition of “Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works”); Star Athletica, L.L.C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 137 S. Ct. 1002, 1009 (2017) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</dd>

            <dt>Display:</dt>
            <dd>“To ‘display’ a work means to show a copy of it, either directly or by means of a film, slide, television image, or any other device or process or, in the case of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to show individual images nonsequentially.” 17 U.S.C. § 101.</dd>

            <dt>Document pertaining to copyright:</dt>
            <dd>“A document shall be considered to ‘pertain to a copyright’ if it has a direct or indirect relationship to the existence, scope, duration, or identification of a copyright, or to the ownership, division, allocation, licensing, transfer, or exercise of rights under a copyright. That relationship may be past, present, future, or potential.” 37 C.F.R. § 201.4(a)(2).</dd>

            <dt>Preregistration:</dt>
            <dd>A procedure that allows certain copyright owners to file an action for infringement and to seek statutory damages and attorney’s fees in cases where the work was infringed before the copyright owner completed the work and released it to the public. Preregistration is entirely optional. It is neither a prerequisite nor a precondition for copyright owners who wish to register their works with the U.S. Copyright Office. In other words, an original work of authorship may be registered regardless of whether the work has been preregistered or not. Copyright owners may benefit from this procedure if they have started to create a work of authorship that has not been completed yet, and if it is likely that a third party may infringe that work before it has been released to the public. But in order to preserve the benefits of this procedure, the copyright owner must seek an actual registration for the work shortly after it has been published or infringed. For the vast majority of copyright owners, preregistration is not useful. To be eligible for preregistration, a work of authorship must fall within one or more of the following classes of works: (i) motion pictures; (ii) sound recordings; (iii) musical compositions; (iv) literary works being prepared for publication in book form; (v) computer programs (including videogames); or (vi) advertising or marketing photographs. Works that do not fall within these classes are not eligible for this procedure.</dd>
