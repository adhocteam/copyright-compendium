<level_title id="glossary-Choreographic-works">Choreographic works</level_title>

It is a discrete subset of dance that encompasses certain types of compositional dances. For example, the legislative history for the 1976 Copyright Act states that "choreographic works' do not include social dance steps and simple routines." See <ref source="report" reportid="H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476">H.R. REP. NO. 94-1476, at 54 (1976)</ref>, reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5659, 5667; <ref source="report" reportid="S. Rep. No. 94-473">S. REP.
