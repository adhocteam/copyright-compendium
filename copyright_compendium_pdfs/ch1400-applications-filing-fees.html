      <paragraph><a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">Section 408(a)</a> of the Copyright Act provides that a copyright owner or the owner of any of the exclusive rights in a work may seek a registration by delivering an application, filing fee, and an appropriate deposit to the U.S. Copyright Office. The Copyright Act gives the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#Register%20of%20Copyrights">Register of Copyrights</a> the authority to establish administrative classes of works for registration, to create application forms, and to specify the information that should be included in the application. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">17 U.S.C. §§ 408(a)</a>, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">408(c)(1)</a>, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#409">409</a>, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap7.html#702">702</a>.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Pursuant to this authority, the U.S. Copyright Office has created five administrative classes for purposes of registration, namely, nondramatic <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#literary%20works">literary works</a> (Class TX), <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#works%20of%20the%20visual%20arts">works of the visual arts</a> (Class VA), <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#works%20of%20the%20performing%20arts">works of the performing arts</a> (Class PA), <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#sound%20recordings">sound recordings</a> (Class SR), and <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#serial">serials</a> (Class SE). The Office has created different versions of its online application and paper applications for each class of works. Registration is administered by the Office's Registration Program, which includes three divisions: Literary, Performing Arts, and Visual Arts. Applications are assigned to one of these divisions, depending on the classification of the work.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>NOTE: The administrative classes are solely for administrative purposes, and they have no bearing on the substantive subject matter of copyright or the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#exclusive%20rights">exclusive rights</a> provided by the copyright law. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">17 U.S.C. § 408(c)(1)</a>.</paragraph>
      <paragraph><a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">Applicants</a> should use the form that is most appropriate for the type of work being registered. If the work contains more than one type of authorship, applicants should use the form that corresponds to the predominant type of copyrightable authorship in that work. For example, if the claim involves a children's book that includes both text and illustrations, the applicant should use the application that corresponds to the predominant form of authorship in the book. If the book contains only a few illustrations, the applicant should use the appropriate application for a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#literary%20work">Literary Work</a>. If the book mostly contains illustrations with a small amount of text, the applicant should use the appropriate application for a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#work%20of%20the%20visual%20arts">Work of the Visual Arts</a>. If the types of authorship are roughly equal, the applicant may use the application that would be appropriate for either type of authorship. See <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-37/chapter-II/subchapter-A/part-202/section-202.3#p-202.3(b)(2)(iii)">37 C.F.R. § 202.3(b)(2)(iii)</a>.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>NOTE: When registering a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#sound%20recording">sound recording</a>, the applicant must use the appropriate application for sound recording authorship, regardless of whether the sound recording is the predominant form of authorship in the work.

      <paragraph><a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#409">Section 409</a> of the Copyright Act states that "[t]he application for copyright registration shall be made on a form prescribed by the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#Register%20of%20Copyrights">Register of Copyrights</a>." <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#409">17 U.S.C. § 409</a>. Although the Register of Copyrights has been given discretion in how to organize and establish the requirements for the Standard Application and paper applications (which are discussed in Sections <a href="#sec-1403">1403</a> and <a href="#sec-1404">1404</a> below), <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#409">Section 409</a> also sets forth certain elements that must be contained in these forms:</paragraph>
      <list list-type="legal">
        <item>
          <num>1.</num> The name and address of the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyright%20claimant">copyright claimant</a>;</item>
        <item>

      </list>
      <paragraph><a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#409">17 U.S.C. § 409(1-9)</a>. The statute also allows the Register to request additional information in the application. Specifically, it grants the Register broad authority to require "any other information [that] bear[s] upon the preparation or identification of the work or the existence, ownership, or duration of the copyright." Id. <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#409">§ 409(10)</a>.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>The Office offers other applications that request some — but not all — of the information listed in <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#409">Section 409</a>, such as the Single Application (which is discussed in Section <a href="#sec-1405">1405</a>). These specialized forms do not request all of the information listed in <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#409">Section 409</a>, because in order to use them certain types of information cannot be present in the claim. For example, an applicant cannot use the Single Application to register a work created by an individual author who transferred his or her copyright to another party. Thus, there is no need to request "a brief statement of how the claimant obtained ownership of the copyright” in this form.</paragraph>
      <paragraph><a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">Section 408(c)(1)</a> of the Copyright Act authorizes the Register to establish an administrative procedure for registering a group of related of works. <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">Section 408(d)</a> authorizes the Register to establish a procedure for issuing a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#supplementary%20registration">supplementary registration</a> to correct or amplify the information given in an existing registration. And <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">Section 408(f)(1)</a> authorizes the Register to establish a procedure for issuing a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#preregistration">preregistration</a> for <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#unpublished">unpublished</a> works that are being prepared for commercial distribution.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Congress gave the Register the discretion to develop an appropriate application for these types of records. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">17 U.S.C. § 408(c)(1), (d), (f)(1)</a>.

      <item><a href="/compendium/glossary.html#sound%20recordings">Sound recordings</a> are works that contain sound recording authorship. An applicant must select the option for "sound recording" if he or she intends to register that element of the work with the Standard Application (even if the work also contains other types of authorship, such as music or lyrics). If the applicant does not intend to register sound recording authorship, the work should be registered using the form that would be appropriate for the predominant type of copyrightable authorship in that work (even if it happens to contain one or more sound recordings). Likewise, the applicant should not select the option for "sound recording" if the applicant intends to register the sounds accompanying a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#motion%20picture">motion picture</a> or other <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#audiovisual%20work">audiovisual work</a>.
        <paragraph>NOTE: The Office only registers sound recordings that were <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#fixed">fixed</a> on or after February 15, 1972.

The Standard Application also may be used to register a single serial issue together with the individual contributions appearing within that issue, if they are fully owned by the claimant when the claim is submitted, and if they have not been published or registered before. If the applicant intends to register an individual contribution, but does not intend to register the issue as a whole, the applicant should use the appropriate form for a "Literary Work” or a "Work of the Visual Arts."

    <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office strongly encourages applicants to use the Standard Application rather than a paper application. Claims submitted through the electronic registration system can be examined more quickly and efficiently, and as a result, the Office charges a lower filing fee for the Standard Application. However, the Office will accept paper applications for claims involving the following types of works:</paragraph>
    <list>
      <item>Form TX may be used to seek a basic registration for a nondramatic literary work, such as fiction, nonfiction, poetry, an individual article, a textbook, a reference work, a directory, a catalog, advertising copy, a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#compilation">compilation</a> of information, a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#computer%20program">computer program</a>, textual works made available online, or a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#database">database</a>.</item>

      <item>Form SR must be used if the applicant intends to register <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#sound%20recording">sound recording</a> authorship with a paper application, even if the work contains additional types of authorship, such as music or lyrics.

    <paragraph>The Single Application is an online form designed for authors who file the simplest kind of claims. The U.S. Copyright Office charges a lower filing fee for this application, which is intended to benefit individual creators and encourage them to register their works.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>This application may be used to register one work by one author that is solely owned by that individual. It also may be used to register one sound recording and one musical work, literary work, or dramatic work if certain requirements have been met. For detailed information concerning these requirements see Sections <a href="#subsec-1405-1">1405.1</a> through <a href="#subsec-1405-7">1405.7</a> below.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the Office determines that a particular work does not satisfy these requirements, it will refuse registration and instruct the applicant to resubmit the claim using the Standard Application. If the applicant wishes to proceed with the claim, he or she must submit a new application, filing fee, and another copy or phonorecord of the work. The effective date of registration will be based on the date that the new submission is received by the Office.</paragraph>

      <paragraph>A Single Application may be certified and submitted by the individual who created the work. But the U.S. Copyright Office recognizes that many authors are not familiar with the electronic registration system, and some individual creators may prefer to have an authorized agent submit the application on their behalf. Therefore, the Office will accept an application that has been certified and submitted by a duly authorized agent, provided that the agent is identified in the Correspondent section of the form.

        <paragraph>Since 1997, the U.S. Copyright Office has undertaken a series of studies to determine what fees to charge for specific services relating to registration. The Office revisits its schedule of fees approximately every three years, a process during which it seeks public comment, adopts some fees, and makes recommendations for other fees to Congress.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The majority of the Office's fee adjustments are guided by <ref source="usc" title="17" section="708">Section 708(b)</ref> of the Copyright Act, which states that, before adjusting certain fees, the Register must conduct a study of the Office's costs for registering <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claims">claims</a> and must consider the timing of any fee adjustments and the Office's authority to use the fees consistent with the Office's budget. <ref source="usc" title="17" section="708">Section 708(b)</ref> also states that the Register may, based on the results of the fee study, adjust some fees “not more than necessary to cover the reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office for ... services ... plus a reasonable inflation adjustment to account for any estimated increase in costs." Finally, <ref source="usc" title="17" section="708">Section 708(b)</ref> mandates that certain fees "shall be fair and equitable and give due consideration to the objectives of the copyright system."</paragraph>

        <paragraph>Applicants submitting paper applications may pay fees from a deposit account or by using checks, money orders, or bank drafts payable to the U.S. Copyright Office. Payment in cash may be made only in person at the Public Information Office.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>Fees paid from a foreign country should be in the form of an international money order or bank check payable and immediately negotiable in the United States for the full amount of the fee required.

        <paragraph>Deposit account holders may take measures to protect against falling below the account minimum. The holder may authorize the Office to automatically replenish the account from the holder's bank account or credit card in an amount determined by the deposit account holder.
