     , it authorized the

    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     The "unpublished collections” accommodation was established when the Office first promulgated regulations implementing the
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyright_act">
      Copyright Act
     </a>
     of 1976. It established a procedure for registering multiple "self-contained works” as a "single work" "on a single application and upon payment of a single registration fee." See
     <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/43-FR-965">
      Part 202 – Registration of Claims to Copyright, 43 Fed. Reg. 965, 966 (Jan. 5, 1978)
     </a>
     . The regulation provided that "[i]n the case of unpublished works, all copyrightable elements that are otherwise recognizable as self-contained works, and are combined in a single unpublished 'collection" "shall be considered a single work."

     in a tangible medium of expression, and if the content of each issue does not change once it has been distributed. For example, a publisher that hand-delivers each issue to its subscribers, or distributes them through newsstands or other retail outlets, would satisfy this requirement because the

     to its subscribers may satisfy this requirement if each issue contains a
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#fixed">
      fixed
     </a>
     selection of content, such as a PDF version of a physical publication. Similarly, a publisher that allows its subscribers to download an eSerial from its website may satisfy this requirement if each issue is distributed as a

     </a>
     and the content of each issue does not change once it has been distributed.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     By contrast, a website would not satisfy this requirement. Websites typically add, archive, and/or replace content on a continuing basis. As such, they are not
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#fixed">
      fixed
     </a>
     and distributed as discrete, self-contained works. Moreover, these updates are rarely distributed on an established schedule, and rarely contain numerical or chronological designations distinguishing one update from the next. For this reason, websites are not considered "

      serials
     </a>
     " for purposes of registration.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     If a
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#serial">
      serial
     </a>
     contains content that appears in both the issue itself and on the publisher's website, the registration may cover that material if it was first published in the

     First, a

     may be used to satisfy the statutory requirements for instituting an

     </a>
     action involving any of the
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#newspaper">

     issues that were included within the group, or any of the individual contributions appearing within those issues—provided that the

    <paragraph>
     Second, a
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#group_registration">
      group registration
     </a>
     may also be used to satisfy the plaintiff's burden of proof by providing a presumption of validity for each
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#registration">
      registered
     </a>
     issue. Specifically, a
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#certificate_of_registration">

     </a>
     "constitute[s] prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate."

      17 U.S.C. § 410(c)
     </a>
     . A
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#group_registration">
      group registration
     </a>

     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claimant">
      claimant
     </a>
     owns the copyright in each issue listed in the certificate, and a presumption that the copyright law protects each issue as a whole.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     Finally, the group as a whole is not considered a
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#compilation">

     </a>
     , a
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#collective_work">

     , or a
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#derivative_work">
      derivative work
     </a>
     . Instead, the group is merely an administrative classification created solely for the purpose of

     </a>
     multiple
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#collective_work">

     with one application and one
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#filing_fee">
      filing fee
     </a>
     . The chronological selection, coordination, and arrangement of the issues within the group is entirely dictated by the regulatory requirements for this option. Likewise, when a group of
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#newspaper">
      newspaper
     </a>
     issues are combined for the purpose of facilitating
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#registration">
      registration
     </a>
     , those works are not "recast, transformed, or adapted" in any way, and the group as a whole is not “a work based upon one or more preexisting works" because there is no copyright authorship in simply collecting a month of issues and arranging them in chronological order.

     Group Registration of Short Online Literary Works
    </section_title>
    <paragraph>
     This Section discusses the U.S. Copyright Office's practices and procedures for registering a group of
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#short_online_literary_work">
      short online literary works
     </a>
     . When referring to this option, the Office uses the term "GRTX."
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     GRTX is intended to benefit individual writers who create short-form works that are
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#publication">
      published
     </a>
     on websites or online platforms that are typically updated on a daily basis.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     When the Office receives a group of
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#short_online_literary_work">
      short online literary works
     </a>
     , it will examine each work to determine if it contains a sufficient amount of
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyrightable">
      copyrightable
     </a>
     text, and to confirm that the legal and formal requirements for registration have been met. A group registration covers the
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyrightable">
      copyrightable
     </a>
     text in each
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#literary_works">
      literary work
     </a>
     that is submitted for registration, and each
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#literary_works">
      literary work
     </a>
     is registered as a separate work.

     </a>
     .
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     If the Office determines that one or more of the works is uncopyrightable, it will refuse to register those works, and issue a registration for the remaining
     <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyrightable">
      copyrightable
     </a>
     works in the group (if any).

      . This category includes a wide variety of textual works, such as fiction, nonfiction, poetry, articles, blogs, and social media posts. These types of works usually explain, describe, or narrate a particular subject, theme, or idea through the use of prose or verse, rather than dialog or dramatic action. Generally, these types of works are intended to be read; they are not intended to be performed before an audience.

      To qualify for this group registration option, a
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#literary_works">
       literary work
      </a>
      must contain a sufficient number of words, and the work cannot be comprised mainly of numbers or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia. Examples of works that typically satisfy this requirement include poems, short stories, articles, essays, columns, blog entries, and social media posts.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      A work will be considered an "online"
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#literary_works">

      if it was first
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#publication">
       published
      </a>
      on the internet. For example, this requirement may be satisfied if a copy or
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copies">
       copies
      </a>
      of the work were first distributed to the public as part of a
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#newspaper">
       newspaper
      </a>
      website, social media website, or social networking platform. It may be satisfied if a copy or
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copies">
       copies
      </a>
      of the work were first distributed on a website or platform that is protected by a password or paywall. Likewise, a work may be eligible for this option if
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copies">
       copies
      </a>
      were simultaneously
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#publication">
       published
      </a>
      both on the internet and in a physical form. By contrast, a work would not qualify for this option if the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copies">
       copies
      </a>
      were distributed solely in a physical form or were distributed in a physical form prior to being

        created
       </a>
       by those same individuals.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For example, an
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">
        applicant
       </a>
       may submit 10 articles written solely by Joanna. Likewise, an

        applicant
       </a>
       may submit 10 articles written jointly by Joanna and Chip.

      <paragraph>
       By contrast, an
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">
        applicant
       </a>
       may not register fifteen blog posts written solely by Joanna together with seven blog posts written jointly by Joanna and Chip. Likewise, the same application may not be used to register fifteen social media posts written by Joanna and the comments on each post that were written by Luis. In each case, the
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">
        applicant
       </a>
       would need to separate the works into different groups and submit a separate application for each group: One application for the fifteen posts written solely by Joanna; a separate application for the seven posts written jointly by Joanna and Chip; and a separate application for the comments written solely by Luis.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       The U.S. Copyright Office will strictly enforce this requirement. If the author information for each and every work is not the same, the registration specialist will refuse to register the entire claim.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       In all cases, the author or joint authors must be named as the
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyright_claimant">
        copyright claimant
       </a>
       for each work in the group. For instance, if an
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">
        applicant
       </a>
       submitted five essays written solely by Chanda, that individual must be named as the
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claimant">
        claimant
       </a>
       for each work. If an
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">
        applicant
       </a>
       submitted 20 essays co-written by Chanda and Caleb, those individuals must be named as the co-claimants for each work.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       To be clear, the author or joint authors must be named as the
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claimant">
        claimant
       </a>
       or co-claimants for all of the works being registered – even if the author(s) no longer own any of the rights in those works.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       This facilitates the examination by allowing the registration specialist to focus on the works themselves, rather than the ownership of each work. Moreover, it is consistent with the basic principle that an author may always be named as the
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyright_claimant">
        copyright claimant
       </a>
       , and the Office's longstanding view that an author may be named as a

        claimant

       even if that person does not own any of the

       Anonymous and Pseudonymous Works
      </provision_title>
      <paragraph>
       A work is "anonymous" if the author is not identified on the copies of that work. A work is "pseudonymous" if the author is identified on the copies solely by a fictitious name, pen name, or other pseudonym. If the author's real name appears on the copies, the work is neither anonymous nor pseudonymous, even if the author does not want to reveal his or her identity in the registration record.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If the author's name does not appear on any of the works – and if the author does not want to reveal his or her identity in the registration record – the applicant should check the box indicating that the works were created anonymously. The fields for the Author's "First Name" and "Last Name" should be left blank.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If the author's pseudonym appears on all of the works and the author's legal name does not appear on any of the works- and if the author does not want to reveal his or her identity in the registration record – the applicant should check the box indicating that the works are pseudonymous, and should provide the author's pseudonym in the field marked "Pseudonym."
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Ordinarily, the copyright for an anonymous or pseudonymous work endures for a term of 95 years from the year of publication or 120 years from the year of creation, whichever expires first.

If the author's real name is included in the application it will become part of the public record, and it cannot be removed once the U.S. Copyright Office has issued a registration.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If the author wants to reveal his or her identity in the registration record, the applicant should provide the author's legal name in the "First Name/Last Name" fields.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If some - but not all – of the works are anonymous or pseudonymous, the applicant may register all of the works with the same application. But to do so, the author must disclose his or her identity in the registration record. For example, if the author wrote 10 short stories, and if her real name appears on two of those stories, she may register
      </paragraph>
      <page label="97">
      </page>

       If the works contain an appreciable amount of material that has been previously published or previously registered, the applicant should exclude that material from the claim. Likewise, applicants should disclaim material that is owned by a third party or material that is in the public domain.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Specifically, the applicant should briefly describe this material on the Limitation of Claim screen in the field marked Material Excluded. The U.S. Copyright Office will assume the applicant intends to register all copyrightable aspects of the works that have not been expressly disclaimed in this portion of the application.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       If the material was previously registered with the U.S. Copyright Office, the applicant should also provide the registration number and year of registration that has been assigned to that material. If the Office issued multiple registrations for this material, the applicant should provide the number and year for the most recent registration.

       When examining a
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#database">
        database
       </a>
       , the principle question that the U.S. Copyright Office must consider is whether the selection, coordination, and/or arrangement of data or other component elements within the
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#database">
        database
       </a>
       is sufficiently creative to warrant registration. A
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#database">
        database
       </a>
       and/or the updates or revisions to that
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#database">
        database
       </a>
       typically contain the following forms of authorship:
      </paragraph>
      <page label="101">
      </page>
      <list>
       <item>
        The selection authorship involved in choosing the material or data that is included in the
        <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#database">
         database
        </a>
        .
       </item>
       <item>
        The coordination authorship involved in classifying, categorizing, ordering, or grouping the material or data.
       </item>
       <item>
        The arrangement authorship involved in determining the placement or arrangement of the material or data within the
        <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#database">
         database
        </a>
        as a whole.
       </item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       Each form of authorship may provide a basis for registering a
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#database">
        database
       </a>
       , provided that the selection, coordination, and/or arrangement is sufficiently creative.

       If the work is registrable as a
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#database">
        database

       , the registration may cover the component elements that appear within the
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#database">
        database
       </a>
       , such as photographs,
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#sound_recordings">
        sound recordings
       </a>
       , or videos, provided that (i) the
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claimant">
        claimant
       </a>
       owns the copyright in those elements, (ii) there is a sufficient amount of creative expression in those elements, and (iii) those elements have not been previously
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#publication">
        published
       </a>
       or previously registered. (In no case may a

        claimant
       </a>
       register elements that are in the

        copyrightable
       </a>
       component elements are not sufficient – in and of themselves – to support a

        database
       </a>
       registration unless the selection, coordination, and/or arrangement of those elements with the
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#database">
        database
       </a>
       is also sufficiently creative.

       A group of updates or revisions should be submitted for
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#group_registration">

       Photographers often display their works on websites and distribute them in catalogs. But as discussed in

        Section 1112
       </a>

       By contrast, when a copyright owner registers a group of photographs under GRUPH or GRPPH, the registration covers each photograph in the group, but the group itself is not considered a

      <paragraph>
       This Section discusses the U.S. Copyright Office's practices and procedures for registering a group of photographs. The Office has established a
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#group_registration">
        group registration
       </a>
       option for
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#unpublished">

       photographs, and a separate

       </a>
       photographs. When referring to these options, the Office uses the terms “GRUPH” and “GRPPH,” respectively.
      </paragraph>

       NOTE: The

       option for
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#unpublished">

       photographs replaces the registration accommodation for "
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#unpublished_collection">
        unpublished collections

      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       When the Office receives a group of photographs, it will examine each photo to determine if it contains a sufficient amount of
       <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyrightable">
        copyrightable
       </a>
       authorship, and to confirm that the legal and formal requirements for registration have been met. A registration for a group of photographs covers the

        copyrightable
       </a>
       authorship in each photo that is submitted for registration, and each photo is registered as a separate work.

       The person or entity who owns the copyright in a photograph determines whether that work should be published. If the author or copyright owner decides to publish a particular photograph, that party decides when, where, and how that work should be published. For purposes of registration, a photograph is published on the specific month, day, and year that a copy or multiple copies of that work are distributed to the public for the first time.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       For example, a photograph may be published when a photographer sends one or more copies of that work to a client. By contrast, the mere public display of a photograph – either by the author, copyright owner, or a third party – does not constitute publication in and of itself.

         On May 1st Parker Peters took 600 photos of the President. Later that day he transmitted one copy of each photo to the publisher of the Daily Trumpet, along with a license to distribute or display each image.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
         On May 2nd the publisher posted one photo on its website. On May 3rd the publisher used a second photo in its social media feed. On November 4th the publisher printed a third photo on the front page of its newspaper. (The publisher saved the rest of the photos for possible use on a future date.)
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
         All 600 photos were published on May 1st when Parker sent copies of these images to the publisher. The fact that the publisher distributed or displayed three photos on May 2nd, May 3rd, and November 4th (and saved the rest) is irrelevant to the publication status of the works.
        </paragraph>
       </item>
      </list>
      <paragraph>
       A photograph is also published when one or more copies of that work are offered to a group of persons for the first time for purposes of further distribution or public display. For instance, a photo may be published when a photographer offers one copy of that work to agencies, wire services, and websites, along with a license to further distribute or publicly display that image. But as mentioned above, the mere public display of a photograph, in and of itself, does not constitute publication.

         All 500 photos were published on January 20th when Adam offered them to a group of persons (namely, the wire services) for purposes of further distribution or public display. The fact that the photos were never publicly displayed or distributed to members of the public is irrelevant to the publication status of the works.

      <paragraph>
       As discussed above, GRUPH and GRPPH may be used to register photographs, but they cannot be used to register any other type of work. For example, the Office will not accept an application that combines photographs with text, illustrations, or other types of artwork.
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
       Another key requirement is that the group must contain no more than 750 photographs. If an applicant exceeds this limit, the registration specialist may register the first 750 photos identified in the title list and remove the rest of the photos from the record, or alternatively, he or she may simply refuse registration.

        The U.S. Copyright Office strongly encourages applicants to combine the digital photos and the title list in a .zip file and upload that file to the electronic registration system.

        Special Relief from the Deposit Requirements
       </provision_title>
       <paragraph>
        The U.S. Copyright Office recognizes that there may be cases where a photographer may not have a digital copy of his or her photos or may find it difficult to create a digital copy for purposes of seeking a group registration. If a photographer is unable to submit his or her photos in a digital format, the applicant may request special relief from the deposit requirements.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        A request for special relief must be made in writing, and it should explain why the photographer is unable to submit digital files that satisfy the deposit requirements described in

         Section 1114.4(A)

        In the case of unpublished photographs, the Office strongly encourages applicants to register their photos before sharing them with any other party. By doing so, applicants will preserve the copyright owner's ability to seek statutory damages and attorney's fees in subsequent

       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        In the case of published photographs, the Office strongly encourages applicants to submit their claims every three months (instead of filing on an annual or semi-annual basis), and in each case, to file the claim within three months after the earliest publication date specified in the application.

         On July 1st the couple downloaded 10 photos from the bridal shower, on July 15th they downloaded 5 photos from the bachelor party, and on July 31st they downloaded all but one of the photos from the wedding day. The couple never shared the photos with anyone else.

         The fact that the couple actually downloaded 10 photos on July 1st, 5 photos on July 15th, and 599 photos on July 31st (and ignored the rest) is irrelevant to the publication status of these works. The fact that the couple never shared the photos with anyone else is also irrelevant.
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
         On August 1st, John submitted an application to register these 750 photographs (together with the correct

        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
         If a third party infringed all of these photographs on July 1st, John should be able to claim statutory damages and attorney's fees for the photos from the bachelor party and the wedding day, because those images were published on May 1st or June 1st, and they were registered less than three months later on August 1st. However, John would not be able to claim these remedies for the photos from the bridal shower, because those images were published on April 1st and registered more than three months later on August 1st.

       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        The title may consist solely of numbers and letters that were automatically assigned by the camera or a unique identifier that has been assigned to the image by a third party, such as the PLUS Registry. The U.S. Copyright Office strongly discourages applicants from stating "untitled,” “no title," or the like, because interested parties typically search for works by title and it may be impossible to locate a particular photo unless a meaningful title has been provided.
       </paragraph>
       <paragraph>
        The Office will use the list to examine and document the

          Lois Lang is a commercial photographer. On February 26, 2018 she took 600 photos for her client's upcoming advertising campaign. On February 27th Lois sent an electronic proof sheet to her client, and stated that the images could not be used without her permission.
         </paragraph>
         <paragraph>
          On February 28th the client selected 30 photos for potential use in their advertising campaign. After retouching the images, Lois sent the client 5 digital prints on March 1st, 10 digital prints on March 2nd, and 15 digital prints on March 3rd. In each case, Lois gave her client a license to use these 30 photos for one year.
         </paragraph>
         <paragraph>
          On April 1st the client posted one of the photos on its website. On April 2nd the client used another photo in its social media feed. On April 3rd the client

         These 30 photos were published when Lois sent a copy of each work to her client on March 1st, 2nd, and 3rd along with a license to use these images. The fact that the client used three of the photos on April 1st, 2nd, and 3rd (but did not use any of the others) is irrelevant to the publication status of the works.

       NOTE: The rest of the photos on the electronic proof sheet have not been published yet.
