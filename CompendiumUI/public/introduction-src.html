  <level_title>What the Compendium Covers</level_title>
  <paragraph>The Compendium documents and explains the many technical requirements, regulations, and legal interpretations of the U.S. Copyright Office with a primary focus on the registration of copyright claims, documentation of copyright ownership, and recordation of copyright documents, including assignments and licenses. It describes the wide range of services that the Office provides for searching, accessing, and</paragraph>
<page label="1"></page>
  <paragraph>retrieving information located in its extensive collection of copyright records and the associated fees for these services. The Compendium provides guidance regarding the contents and scope of particular registrations and records. And it seeks to educate applicants about a number of common mistakes, such as providing incorrect, ambiguous, or insufficient information, or making overbroad claims of authorship.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>The Compendium does not cover every principle of copyright law or detail every aspect of the Office's administrative practices. The Office may, in exceptional circumstances, depart from its normal practices to ensure an outcome that is most appropriate.</paragraph>
  <level_title>Standard of Deference for the Compendium</level_title>
  <paragraph>The Compendium does not override any existing statute or regulation. The policies and practices set forth in the Compendium do not in themselves have the force and effect of law and are not binding upon the Register of Copyrights or Copyright Office staff. However, the Compendium does explain the legal rationale and determinations of the Copyright Office, where applicable, including circumstances where there is no controlling judicial authority.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>The Supreme Court recognized that courts may consider the interpretations set forth in administrative manuals, policy statements, and similar materials "to the extent that those interpretations have 'the power to persuade.” <ref source="case">Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000)</ref> (internal citations omitted); <ref source="case">Georgia v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 140 S. Ct. 1498, 1510 (2020)</ref> (applying "power to persuade" standard to the Compendium). The weight of [the agency's] judgment . . . in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade . . . .” <ref source="case">Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)</ref>.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Courts have cited the Compendium in numerous copyright cases. See, e.g., <ref source="case">Olem Shoe Corp. v. Washington Shoe Corp., 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 434, at *20-21 (11th Cir. Jan 12, 2015)</ref> (finding that the Compendium's construction of the Copyright Act's requirements for disclaiming preexisting works during registration "merits deference"); <ref source="case">Alaska Stock, LLC v. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Co., 747 F.3d 673, 684 (9th Cir. 2014)</ref> (finding the Compendium “persuasive” concerning the registration requirements for databases); <ref source="case">Metropolitan Regional Information Systems, Inc. v. American Home Realty Network, Inc., 888 F. Supp. 2d 691, 706-07 (D. Md. 2012)</ref> (deferring to the Compendium concerning the registration requirements for collective works); <ref source="case">Rogers v. Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan Houston, Inc., 887 F. Supp. 2d 722, 732 (S.D. Tex. 2012)</ref> ("The Copyright Office's 'policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines' do not carry 'the force of law,' but they are entitled to some deference given the 'specialized experience and broader investigations and information' of the agency."); <ref source="case">McLaren v. Chico's FAS, Inc., 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 120185, at **9-10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2010)</ref> (concluding that the Office's interpretation of the unit of publication regulation "is particularly compelling").

  <level_title>First and Second Editions of the Compendium</level_title>
  <paragraph>The first edition of the Compendium (commonly referred to as "Compendium I") governed the Office's general practices for registration, recordation, and other matters arising under the Copyright Act of 1909. Largely an internal manual, it was directed to the Office's examining staff. Compendium I was made available to the public for the first time in 1967 and it was last revised in 1973. See <ref source="compendium">U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE, Introduction to COMPENDIUM OF U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE PRACTICES (1st ed. 1973)</ref>; <ref source="FedReg">Inspection and Copying of Records and Other Documents, 32 Fed. Reg. 9314 (June 30, 1967)</ref>.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>The second edition of the Compendium (commonly referred to as "Compendium II") was also designed for internal use. Compendium II reflects the Copyright Office's general practices for registration, recordation, and other matters arising under the Copyright Act of 1976, prior to the adoption of the Third Edition. It was first published in 1984 and revised in part in 1988 and 1998. In 1988 the Office added Chapter 600 (Registration Procedures) and Chapter 1900 (Records, Indexes and Deposits). In 1995 the Office amended Chapter 600, § 606
