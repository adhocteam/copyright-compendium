   <paragraph>
    This site provides a navigable, searchable web display of the U.S. Copyright Office's <em>Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices</em>, Third Edition. The Compendium is the administrative manual of the Register of Copyrights and provides expert guidance to copyright applicants, practitioners, scholars, the courts, and the general public regarding copyright law and institutional practices.

     Experimental Transformation
    </section_title>
    <paragraph>
     <strong>This is an experimental transformation</strong> of the official Copyright Compendium from PDF format to HTML for web display. The Compendium is officially published by the U.S. Copyright Office as PDF files, which can be challenging to navigate online. This project aims to make the Compendium more accessible by converting it into a web-friendly format with enhanced navigation and search capabilities.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     The transformation from PDF to XHTML was accomplished using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental. Each chapter of the Compendium was processed to extract and convert the text while preserving:
    </paragraph>
    <list>
     <item>Document structure and hierarchy</item>
     <item>Section numbering and cross-references</item>
     <item>Internal hyperlinks to other chapters and sections</item>
     <item>External hyperlinks to legal citations and copyright.gov resources</item>
     <item>Formatting such as italics, lists, and emphasis</item>
    </list>
    <paragraph>
     While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, this is an <strong>unofficial, experimental version</strong>. For authoritative information, please consult the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/">official PDF version on copyright.gov</a>.

     Quality Assurance and Text-Checking
    </section_title>
    <paragraph>
     To ensure the accuracy of the transformation, an <strong>automated quality assurance engine</strong> has been developed to validate the converted content. This QA system compares the HTML output against the original PDF text to detect any discrepancies or conversion errors.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     The text-checker employs two complementary approaches:
    </paragraph>
    <list>
     <item><strong>Algorithmic validation:</strong> Character-level diff comparisons between the source PDF text and the resulting HTML content</item>
     <item><strong>LLM-based review:</strong> AI-powered analysis using the Gemini API to identify semantic differences and quality issues</item>
    </list>
    <paragraph>
     Each identified issue is classified by severity (HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW) to help prioritize corrections. A GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs these quality checks whenever HTML files are updated, ensuring ongoing accuracy as the site evolves.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     For detailed information about the QA methodology, see the <a href="https://github.com/adhocteam/copyright-compendium/blob/main/QA.md">QA documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adhocteam/copyright-compendium/tree/main/tests">test suite</a> in the project repository.

     Purpose of This Site
    </section_title>
    <paragraph>
     The Copyright Compendium is an essential resource for anyone working with U.S. copyright law, but the official PDF format presents several usability challenges:
    </paragraph>
    <list>
     <item>Difficult to navigate between chapters and sections</item>
     <item>Limited search functionality</item>
     <item>Not optimized for mobile devices</item>
     <item>Challenging to link to specific sections from external sources</item>
    </list>
    <paragraph>
     This web viewer addresses these challenges by providing:
    </paragraph>
    <list>
     <item><strong>Easy navigation:</strong> A hierarchical sidebar shows the structure of each chapter, making it simple to jump to any section</item>
     <item><strong>Powerful search:</strong> Algolia-powered search enables finding specific terms and sections across the entire Compendium</item>
     <item><strong>Responsive design:</strong> The interface adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices using the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)</item>
     <item><strong>Direct linking:</strong> Each section has a stable URL that can be bookmarked or shared</item>
     <item><strong>Preserved hyperlinks:</strong> All cross-references and citations from the original PDF remain functional</item>
     <item><strong>Experimental translation:</strong> Browser-based translation support for 12 languages (where supported by browser)</item>
    </list>
    <paragraph>
     By making the Compendium more accessible and user-friendly, this project aims to support copyright applicants, legal practitioners, researchers, and anyone seeking to understand U.S. Copyright Office practices.

     This project builds on the foundation laid by <a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/compendium/introduction.html">Public.Resource.Org</a>, which created the first web version of the 2014 Compendium. Our goal is to provide an updated, maintained version that keeps pace with the Copyright Office's revisions.
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph>
     The project leverages several key technologies:
    </paragraph>
    <list>
