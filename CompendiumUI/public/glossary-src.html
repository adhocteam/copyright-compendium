The certificate denotes the fact that the Office has received a valid claim to copyright (i.e., an acceptable application, deposit, and filing fee) and that the claim has been registered by the Office. The certificate shows the registration number and date that the registration is effective. Provided the claim is registered before the work is published or within five years of the date on which the work is first published, the facts on a certificate of registration and the validity of the copyright are presumed true by courts of law unless later shown to be false.

    Choreographic works
   </dt>
   <p>
    The term "choreography" is derived from the Greek words "choreia,” meaning "dance,” and “graphikos,” meaning “to write.” A dance is a static and kinetic succession of bodily movements in certain rhythmic and spatial relationships and in relation to time and space. Choreography is the composition and arrangement of a related series of dance movements and patterns organized into a coherent whole. Choreography is not synonymous with dance. It is a discrete subset of dance that encompasses certain types of compositional dances. For example, the legislative history for the 1976 Copyright Act states that "choreographic works' do not include social dance steps and simple routines." See

    Preregistration
   </dt>
   <p>
    A procedure that allows certain copyright owners to file an action for infringement and to seek statutory damages and attorney's fees in cases where the work was infringed before the copyright owner completed the work and released it to the public. Preregistration is entirely optional. It is neither a prerequisite nor a precondition for copyright owners who wish to register their works with the U.S. Copyright Office. In other words, an original work of authorship may be registered regardless of whether the work has been preregistered or not. Copyright owners may benefit from this procedure if they have started to create a work of authorship that has not been completed yet, and if it is likely that a third party may infringe that work before it has been released to the public. But in order to preserve the benefits of this procedure, the copyright owner must seek an actual registration for the work shortly after it has been published or infringed. For the vast majority of copyright owners, preregistration is not useful. To be eligible for preregistration, a work of authorship must fall within one or more of the following classes of works:
    <ul>
     <li>
      (i) motion pictures;
     </li>
     <li>
      (ii) sound recordings;
     </li>
     <li>
      (iii) musical compositions;
     </li>
     <li>
      (iv) literary works being prepared for publication in book form;
     </li>
     <li>
      (v) computer programs (including videogames); or
     </li>
     <li>
      (vi) advertising or marketing photographs.
     </li>
    </ul>
    Works that do not fall within these classes are not eligible for this procedure.

The status of a creative work which, through expiration of term or failure to comply with statutory formalities, is not protected by copyright.

    In certain circumstances, the U.S. Copyright Office may register a claim under the Rule of Doubt if the registration specialist is unable to examine the deposit copy(ies) to determine if the work contains copyrightable authorship. In exceptional cases, the Office may apply the Rule of Doubt if it has not taken a position on a legal issue that is directly relevant to whether the work constitutes copyrightable subject matter or whether the other legal and formal requirements of the statute have been met. The Office will not register a claim under the Rule of Doubt simply because there is some uncertainty as to how a particular issue may be decided by a particular court.
