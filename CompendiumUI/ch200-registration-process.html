   <num>202</num> Purposes and Advantages of Registration
  </section_title>
  <paragraph>Under the current copyright law, a work of authorship is protected by copyright from the moment it is created, provided that the work is original and has been <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#fixed">fixed</a> in a tangible medium of expression. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102">17 U.S.C. §§ 102(a)</a>, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">408(a)</a>. Although registration is not required for a work to be protected by copyright, it does provide several important benefits:</paragraph>
  <list>
   <item>
    <paragraph>A registration creates a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#public_record">public record</a> that includes key facts relating to the authorship and ownership of the claimed work, as well as information about the work, such as title, year of creation, date of <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#publication">publication</a> (if any), and the type of authorship that the work contains (e.g., photographs, text, <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#sound_recordings">sound recordings</a>).</paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>A registration (or a refusal to register) is a prerequisite to filing a lawsuit for copyright <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#infringement">infringement</a> involving a United States work. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#411">17 U.S.C. § 411(a)</a>. A 'registration... has been made' within the meaning of <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#411">17 U.S.C. § 411(a)</a> . . . when the Register has registered a copyright after examining a properly filed application." <ref source="case" title="Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com, LLC">Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com, LLC, 139 S. Ct. 881, 892 (2019)</ref>. “[R]egistration is akin to an administrative exhaustion requirement that the owner must satisfy before suing to enforce ownership rights," because "it is the Register's action that triggers a copyright owner's entitlement to sue.” Id. at 887, 890. “Once the Register grants or refuses registration, the copyright owner may also seek an injunction barring the infringer from continued violation of her exclusive rights and an order requiring the infringer to destroy infringing materials." Id. (citing <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#502">17 U.S.C. §§ 502</a>, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#503">503(b)</a>).</paragraph>
    <paragraph>NOTE: There are three exceptions to this rule. A registration or a refusal is not needed to file a lawsuit suit involving a foreign work. Id. at 891. <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">Section 408(f)</a> of the Copyright Act allows the owner of a work that is “especially susceptible to prepublication infringement. . . to institute suit before the Register has granted or refused registration.” Id. at 892. <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#411">Section 411(c)</a> provides a similar exception for infringements involving live broadcasts. “As to all other works, however, § 411(a)'s general rule requires owners to await action by the Register before filing suit for infringement." Id.</paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>To claim statutory damages or attorney's fees in a copyright infringement lawsuit, a work must be registered before the infringement began or within three months after the first <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#publication">publication</a> of the work. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#412">17 U.S.C. §§ 412(c)</a>, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504">504</a>, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#505">505</a>. "If [the] infringement occurs before a copyright owner applies for registration, that owner may eventually recover [actual] damages for the past infringement and the infringer's profits," but if the claim involves a United States work, the owner must "apply for registration and receive the Copyright Office's decision on her application before instituting suit.” <ref source="case" title="Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com, LLC">Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp., 139 S. Ct. at 891</ref>.</paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>A registration constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and the facts stated in the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#certificate_of_registration">certificate of registration</a>, but only if the work is registered before or within five years after the work is first published.</paragraph>
   </item>
   <page label="4"></page>
   <item>
    <paragraph>A registration provides information to prospective licensees, such as the name and address for obtaining permission to use the work.</paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>A document that has been recorded with the U.S. Copyright Office may provide constructive notice of the facts stated therein, but only if the document specifically identifies a work of authorship and only if that work has been registered. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#205">17 U.S.C. § 205(c)(1)-(2)</a>.</paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>The <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#deposit_copy_deposit_copies">deposit copy(ies)</a> submitted with an application for registration of a published work may satisfy the mandatory deposit requirement, provided that the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">applicant</a> submitted the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#best_edition">best edition</a> of the work. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#407">17 U.S.C. §§ 407</a>, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">408(b)</a>.</paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>A registration is necessary to secure the full benefits of a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#preregistration">preregistration</a> that has been issued by the U.S. Copyright Office. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">17 U.S.C. § 408(f)(3)</a>.</paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service may seize foreign pirated copies of a copyright owner's work, provided that the work has been registered with the U.S. Copyright Office and the certificate of registration has been recorded with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Service.</paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>"To be entitled to receive royalties under [the section 115] compulsory license for nondigital uses, the copyright owner must be identified in the registration or other public records of the Copyright Office." See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#115">17 U.S.C. § 115(c)(1)(A)</a>.</paragraph>

   <num>202.1</num> Types of Registrations
  </subsection_title>
  <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office registers claims to copyright in works of authorship. As a general rule, the Office will issue one registration for each work that is submitted for registration. Generally, the Office will not issue separate registrations for the constituent elements or individual components of a work of authorship. And as discussed <a href="/compendium/ch500-identifying-works.html#sec-503-1-A">Chapter 500, Section 503.1(A)</a>, the Office generally will not issue separate registrations to each author who contributed copyrightable expression to the work.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office currently offers the following types of registrations:</paragraph>
  <list>
   <item>
    <paragraph>
     <span style="font-style:italic">Basic registrations.</span> An application for a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#basic_registration">basic registration</a> is used to register a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyright_claim">copyright claim</a> in a work created or first published on or after January 1, 1978, and covers the full term of the copyright. This type of registration may be obtained with a Standard Application, a Single Application (provided certain eligibility requirements have been met), or a paper application. For a discussion of these applications, see <a href="/compendium/ch1400-applications-filing-fees.html#sec-1403">Chapter 1400, Sections 1403</a> and <a href="/compendium/ch1400-applications-filing-fees.html#sec-1405">1405</a>.
    </paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>
     <span style="font-style:italic">Group registrations.</span> An application for a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#group_registration">group registration</a> is used to register a claim to copyright in a group of related works that qualify for a single registration. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">17 U.S.C. § 408(c)(1), (2)</a>. For a detailed discussion of group registration, see <a href="/compendium/ch1100-registration-multiple-works.html">Chapter 1100</a>.

     <span style="font-style:italic">GATT registration.</span> An application for a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#gatt_registration">GATT registration</a> is used to register a copyright claim in a work in which U.S. copyright was restored by the 1994 <ref source="act" title="Uruguay Round Agreements Act">Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA)</ref>. See <ref source="act" title="Uruguay Round Agreements Act">Uruguay Round Agreements Act, 103 P.L. 465, 108 Stat. 4809 (1994)</ref> (codified as amended at <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#104A">17 U.S.C. § 104A</a>).

   <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#preregistration">Preregistration</a> is a special service that is intended for specific types of works that are likely to be infringed before they are completed or before they are released for commercial distribution, such as feature films.

  </subsection_title>
  <paragraph>Registration and <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#recordation">recordation</a> are two separate procedures: <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claims">claims</a> to copyright are registered, while documents related to copyright claims, such as agreements to <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#transfer_of_copyright_ownership">transfer</a> or grant a mortgage in copyrights, are recorded. As discussed in <a href="#sec-204">Section 204</a>, an <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">applicant</a> must submit an application, <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#deposit_copy_deposit_copies">deposit copy(ies)</a>, and a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#filing_fee">filing fee</a> to register a claim to copyright, and together these items are the primary source of information for the claim. As a general rule, the applicant does not need to submit additional documents substantiating the information provided in these materials.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Registering a claim to copyright is not a substitute for recording a document with the U.S. Copyright Office, and recording a document is not a substitute for registering a claim to copyright. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#205">17 U.S.C. § 205</a>.

   <num>203</num> Timing of Registration
  </section_title>
  <paragraph>Registration may be made at any time before the copyright has entered the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#public_domain">public domain</a>. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap3.html#302">17 U.S.C. §§ 302</a>-<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap3.html#305">305</a> and <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#408">408(a)</a>. Generally speaking, a copyrighted work enters the public domain in the United States when "its full copyright term has expired." <ref source="case" title="Golan v. Holder">Golan v. Holder, 565 U.S. 302, 307 (2012)</ref>.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office strongly encourages copyright owners to submit their works for registration in a timely manner. As discussed in <a href="#sec-202">Section 202</a>, a registration (or a refusal to register) is a prerequisite for filing a lawsuit for copyright <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#infringement">infringement</a> involving a United States work. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#411">17 U.S.C. § 411(a)</a>. It is also a prerequisite for seeking <page label="6"></page> statutory damages and attorney's fees in an infringement action. To pursue these remedies, an <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#unpublished_work">unpublished</a> work must be registered before the infringement occurs, while a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#published_work">published</a> work must be registered within three months after <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#publication">publication</a> or before the infringement occurs. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#412">17 U.S.C. § 412</a>. Moreover, if the work is registered before or within five years after the work is first published, the registration constitutes <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> evidence of the validity of the copyright and the facts stated in the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#certificate_of_registration">certificate of registration</a>.</paragraph>

  </subsection_title>
  <paragraph>An <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">applicant</a> must use the official applications provided by the U.S. Copyright Office. Most <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claims">claims</a> may be submitted online by using the Office's electronic registration system, and in some cases applicants are required to use the online application to seek a registration.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Applicants generally may submit a paper application as an alternative to using the electronic system, although applicants are required to use a paper application for certain types of claims.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Each type of application is discussed in <a href="#prov-204-1-A">Sections 204.1(A)</a> and <a href="#prov-204-1-B">204.1(B)</a> below.</paragraph>

  </provision_title>
  <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office's electronic registration system may be accessed from the Office's <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/registration/">website</a>.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>The Office strongly encourages <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicants">applicants</a> to use the online application whenever possible. The benefits to filing an online application include:</paragraph>
  <page label="7"></page>
  <list>
   <item>
    <paragraph>
     <span style="font-style:italic">Lower filing fees for online applications:</span> The <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#filing_fee">filing fee</a> for an online application is lower than the filing fee for a paper application. For a list of the current filing fees, see the Office's <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/about/fees.html">fee schedule</a>.
    </paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>
     <span style="font-style:italic">Faster processing:</span> The Office typically processes electronic <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claims">claims</a> much sooner than non-electronic claims. Current processing times are listed on the Office's <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/registration/docs/processing-times-faqs.pdf">website</a>.
    </paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>
     <span style="font-style:italic">Multiple options for paying the filing fee:</span> An applicant may pay the filing fee for an online application by credit card, debit card, electronic check, or with a U.S. Copyright Office deposit account, while in most cases an applicant may pay the filing fee for a paper application only by check, money order, or deposit account.
    </paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>
     <span style="font-style:italic">Easier submission of the deposit copy(ies):</span> For certain types of works, the applicant may upload <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#deposit_copy_deposit_copies">deposit copy(ies)</a> directly to the online system as an electronic file, instead of having to submit physical deposit copies through the mail. The Office lists the acceptable file types on its <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/eco/help-file-types.html">website</a>. If the work is published in hard copy form, the applicant may be required to mail a physical copy to the Office, but filing the application electronically will expedite processing.
    </paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>
     <span style="font-style:italic">The ability to track the status of the application:</span> After submission, the online system allows the applicant to log in and see whether the online application is still pending or whether it has been registered and closed.

  <paragraph>If the applicant fails to submit the correct filing fee, a member of the Office's staff will notify the applicant in writing. If the applicant submits the correct filing fee within the specified time frame, the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#effective_date_of_registration">effective date of registration</a> will be changed to reflect the date that the funds were received. If the Office does not receive the correct filing fee within the specified time frame, it will close the file.

   <num>204.3</num> Deposit Copy(ies)
  </subsection_title>
  <paragraph>The term "<a href="/compendium/glossary.html#deposit">deposit</a>" is frequently misunderstood. It refers to the copy or copies of a work that are submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office. It does not refer to the filing fee that must be paid in order to register a work with the Office.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>As a general rule, the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">applicant</a> must submit a complete copy or copies of the work to register a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claim">claim</a> to copyright. In certain cases, the U.S. Copyright Office may accept <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#identifying_material">identifying material</a> in lieu of a complete copy, or the Office may grant <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#special_relief">special relief</a> from the deposit requirements. (For a definition and discussion of identifying material and special relief, see <a href="/compendium/ch1500-deposits.html#sec-1506">Chapter 1500, Sections 1506</a> and <a href="/compendium/ch1500-deposits.html#sec-1508-8">1508.8</a>.) As discussed above, the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#deposit_copy_deposit_copies">deposit copy(ies)</a> for a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#published_work">published</a> work also may satisfy the mandatory deposit requirement for certain works that are published in the United States.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>If the applicant fails to submit a complete copy of the work, fails to submit sufficient identifying material, and/or fails to obtain special relief from the deposit requirements, the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#registration_specialist">registration specialist</a> may communicate with the applicant or may refuse registration. If the specialist asks the applicant to resubmit the deposit copy(ies) but does not receive the correct deposit within the specified time frame, the specialist will close the file. If the applicant wishes to resubmit the claim, the applicant must file a new application, new deposit copy(ies), and the correct filing fee. The <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#effective_date_of_registration">effective date of registration</a> for a new claim will be based on the date that the new submission is received by the Office.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>In specific instances, the deposit copy(ies) may be submitted in digital or physical format. The deposit copy(ies) must conform to certain requirements depending on the type of work, the deposit requirements, and whether the work is published or <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#unpublished_work">unpublished</a>. As a general rule, the deposit copy(ies) should be clear and should contain all the authorship that the applicant intends to register. An application submitted with an incomplete or unclear deposit copy(ies) may be delayed until the Office receives a complete and/or clear copy or may be refused. Delays due to incomplete and/or unclear deposit copy (ies) may affect the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#effective_date_of_registration">effective date of registration</a>, which is discussed in <a href="#sec-209">Section 209</a> below.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Once the Office receives the registration materials, a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#registration_specialist">registration specialist</a> will examine the deposit copy(ies) to determine if the work is eligible for registration. The Office will not return the deposit copy(ies) or the identifying material to the applicant.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>General information on the procedure for submitting the deposit copy(ies) in digital or physical format is set forth in <a href="#prov-204-3-A">Sections 204.3(A)</a> and <a href="#prov-204-3-B">204.3(B)</a> below.

  </paragraph>
  <paragraph>With regard to copyright registrations, the Office requests and receives personally identifiable information ("PII"), such as birth dates, addresses, and telephone numbers. The collection of certain types of PII is mandated by statute or regulation, while other requested information is optional for the applicant to provide. See <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#409">17 U.S.C. § 409</a>. Both types of information are collectively referred to as “Requested PII.”</paragraph>
  <paragraph>The Office will make information provided in a copyright application available to the general public upon request, and much of this information will be available on the Internet through the Office's online database. For an example of the type of information that is typically displayed in the Office's online database, see the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/docs/privacy.html">privacy page</a> on the Office's website.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>The Office does not request, but sometimes receives, additional PII, such as driver's license, social security, and credit card numbers. This type of information is unnecessary for copyright registration and is referred to in the Office's regulations as “extraneous PII." See <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-37/chapter-II/subchapter-A/part-201/section-201.2#p-201.2(f)">37 C.F.R. § 201.2(f)</a>.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Applicants should not provide extraneous PII in an application. To protect the privacy of applicants, the Office may remove this type of information from an application during the examination process on its own initiative. If extraneous PII is included within the Office's public records, an author or claimant may request removal of this information in accordance with the Office's regulations. There is no fee for this service. See id.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Additionally, applicants should not provide any other type of private or confidential information in the application that is not required for registration, because it may also be included in the Office's online and offline public records.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Before submitting an application, an applicant should consider whether to include a nickname, alias, or other personal information that is not required for registration. For example, providing the name, address, telephone number, and email address of the person who should be contacted for permission to use the work is optional, and the Office will accept an application even if an applicant leaves the Rights and Permissions section blank. Although an applicant is encouraged to provide contact information for rights and permission purposes, it is important to understand that if the applicant <page label="13"></page> completes this portion of the application, the Office will include this information in the online database.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>If an applicant wants to provide contact information for persons who may be interested in using the work — but does not want to provide a home address or other personal information - the applicant should consider providing the name of a designated agent, a P.O. Box, or a designated email address in the Rights and Permissions field of the application.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Modification of the information in the Office's online public record (but not its offline public record) is available where the author or claimant submits a written request to remove or replace non-personally identifiable information for certain types of Requested PII (such as replacing a home address with a P.O. Box number), and pays the appropriate fee for this service.

  </section_title>
  <paragraph>Special handling is a procedure for expediting the examination of an application to register a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claim">claim</a> to copyright. There is an additional fee for this expedited service. For information concerning this fee, see the Office's <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/about/fees.html">fee schedule</a>.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office offers this service in certain circumstances where a copyright owner or other interested parties have a compelling reason for an expedited decision on a pending application. Special handling may be requested for an online application or a paper application in the following circumstances:</paragraph>
  <list>
   <item>
    <paragraph>Pending or prospective litigation;</paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>Customs matters; or</paragraph>
   </item>
   <item>
    <paragraph>Contract or publishing deadlines that necessitate the expedited issuance of a certificate of registration.</paragraph>
   </item>
  </list>
  <page label="14"></page>
  <paragraph>A request for special handling may be made when the claim is submitted to the Office or any time before the Office issues a certificate of registration or a refusal. Once it has received and approved a request for special handling, the Office will make every attempt to process the application within five business days, although the Office cannot guarantee that it will process all special handling applications within that time frame, particularly if the claims present issues requiring correspondence.</paragraph>

  </section_title>
  <paragraph>An <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">applicant</a> may submit a request to withdraw a pending application at any time before the U.S. Copyright Office has issued a certificate of registration or has refused to register the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claim">claim</a>. The request should be made in writing and it should explain why the applicant is seeking to withdraw the claim.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>The request should be addressed to the “Associate Register of Copyrights and Director of Registration Policy &amp; Practice.” The applicant may email the request to the registration specialist who has been assigned to the claim. Alternatively, the applicant may mail the request to the following address:</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Associate Register of Copyrights and Director of Registration Policy &amp; Practice Registration Program U.S. Copyright Office 101 Independence Avenue SE Washington, DC 20559</paragraph>
  <paragraph>The Office will use its discretion to decide whether to approve or deny a timely withdrawal request. In making this decision, the Office will balance the interest of the applicant with the public interest in maintaining the integrity of the registration record. The Office does not routinely grant withdrawals, particularly where the request is made merely to avoid a refusal to register.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>In the event that the Office approves a withdrawal request, the Office will not refund the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#filing_fee">filing fee</a> and will not return the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#deposit_copy_deposit_copies">deposit copy (ies)</a>. The Office will not reinstate an application once it has been withdrawn.

The <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#effective_date_of_registration">effective date of registration</a> for a new claim will be based on the date that the new submission is received by the Office.</paragraph>

    <paragraph>Registrations and renewal registrations issued under the current statute (the 1976 Act) expire when the work enters the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#public_domain">public domain</a> in the United States. As discussed in <a href="#sec-203">Section 203</a>, a copyrighted work enters the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#public_domain">public domain</a> in this country when the copyright term for that work has expired under U.S. law.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Registrations issued under the prior statute (the 1909 Act) expire at the end of the first twenty-eight years of the copyright term, and if the copyright is renewed, the renewal registration expires at the end of the renewal term.
