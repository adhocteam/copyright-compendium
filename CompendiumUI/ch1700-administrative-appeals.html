        <paragraph>This Chapter discusses the process for appealing a refusal to register a copyright claim within the U.S. Copyright Office.</paragraph>
    </section>

    <section label="1702" id="sec-1702">
        <section_title><num>1702</num> Registration Refused After Examination</section_title>
        <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office does not register all claims to copyright. The Office may refuse to register claims that do not meet the statutory requirements for copyright registration, including on the following grounds:</paragraph>
        <list>
            <item>The applicant failed to submit a complete application, complete filing fee, and/or complete deposit copy(ies).</item>
            <item>The work is not fixed in a tangible medium of expression.</item>
            <item>The work lacks human authorship.</item>
            <item>The applicant asserts a claim to copyright in a work that is not covered by U.S. copyright law. See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="102" cite="17 U.S.C. §§ 102">17 U.S.C. §§ 102</ref>, <ref source="USC" title="17" section="103" cite="17 U.S.C. § 103">103</ref>.</item>
            <item>The work was not independently created.</item>
            <item>The work lacks the minimum level of creative authorship to support a copyright claim.</item>
            <item>The work is in the public domain.</item>
            <item>The work is a sound recording that was fixed before February 15, 1972 (<i>i.e.</i>, the date on which sound recordings became eligible for federal copyright protection).</item>
            <item>NOTE: The Orrin G. Hatch – Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act (“MMA”) provides owners of pre-1972 sound recordings with certain protections and remedies for copyright infringement if their recordings are used without authorization. To exercise these remedies, owners typically must file schedules with the U.S. Copyright Office listing their sound recordings and specifying the name of the rights owner, title, and featured artist for each recording. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="1401" subsection="f" paragraph="5" subparagraph="A" cite="17 U.S.C. § 1401(f)(5)(A)">17 U.S.C. § 1401(f)(5)(A)</ref>. Additional information concerning the MMA and instructions on how to file a schedule is available on the Office’s website.</item>
            <item>The work is an architectural work created before December 1, 1990 (<i>i.e.</i>, the date on which architectural works became eligible for federal copyright protection), or the application to register the architectural work does not otherwise meet the requirements set forth in Copyright Office regulations. See <ref source="CFR" title="37" part="202" section="11" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.11">37 C.F.R. § 202.11</ref>.</item>
            <item>The work is ineligible for copyright protection in the United States based on the author’s citizenship or domicile, based on the nation of first publication, or any other factor set forth in Section 104 of the Copyright Act.</item>
            <item>The work does not meet the eligibility requirements for a particular registration option.</item>
            <item>The applicant is not authorized to register a claim in the work.</item>
            <item>The claimant named in the application is not a proper copyright claimant.</item>
            <item>The work unlawfully employs preexisting material that is under copyright protection. See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="103" subsection="a" cite="17 U.S.C. § 103(a)">17 U.S.C. § 103(a)</ref>; see also Chapter 300, Section 313.6(B).</item>
            <item>The applicant failed to submit a <i>bona fide</i> copy of the work. See Chapter 1500, Section 1503.2.</item>
        </list>
        <paragraph>If the Office determines that the work does not constitute copyrightable subject matter or that the other formal and legal requirements have not been met, the Office will refuse to register the claim. The registration specialist assigned to the application will notify the applicant in writing and will explain the reasons for the Office’s decision. See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="410" subsection="b" cite="17 U.S.C. § 410(b)">17 U.S.C. § 410(b)</ref>. The Office will send the notification to the correspondent listed in the Correspondent section of the application.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>If the applicant disagrees with a refusal to register the entire work or a refusal to register a specific element of the work, the applicant may appeal that decision within the U.S. Copyright Office. This is an administrative procedure known as a first request for reconsideration.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>A request for reconsideration must be in writing. The request should specify the reasons that the applicant believes that registration was improperly refused, including any legal arguments or supplementary information that support the applicant’s position. <ref source="CFR" title="37" part="202" section="5" subsection="b" paragraph="1" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.5(b)(1)">37 C.F.R. § 202.5(b)(1)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The applicant must provide the following information in the subject line on the first page of the request:</paragraph>
            <list>
                 <item>A statement that the document is a “FIRST RECONSIDERATION.”</item>
                 <item>The ten digit case number/ service request number that the Office assigned to the claim and the seven digit correspondence ID number that appears in the subject line of the letter refusing to register the work.</item>
                 <item>The name of the copyright claimant(s) specified in the application and the title(s) of the work exactly as it appears in the application.</item>
            </list>
            <paragraph>The pages of the first request should be numbered, including any attachments or exhibits thereto.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The applicant should send one copy of the request to the address specified in Section 1708.2, together with one copy of the reply sheet that was attached to the refusal to register, and the filing fee set forth in <ref source="CFR" title="37" part="201" section="3" subsection="d" paragraph="4" subparagraph="i" cite="37 C.F.R. § 201.3(d)(4)(i)">37 C.F.R. § 201.3(d)(4)(i)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The request and the filing fee must be postmarked or dispatched by a commercial carrier, courier, or messenger within three months of the date set forth in the refusal. See Sections 1708.1 and 1708.3.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>See generally <ref source="CFR" title="37" part="202" section="5" subsection="b" paragraph_range="1-3" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.5(b)(1)-(3)">37 C.F.R. § 202.5(b)(1)-(3)</ref> (setting forth the procedure for submitting a first request for reconsideration).</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The first request for reconsideration will be reviewed by a U.S. Copyright Office staff attorney in the Registration Program office who did not participate in the initial examination of the claim. The Office will base its decision on the applicant’s submission and the administrative record. If the Office needs additional information in order to make its decision, the staff attorney will notify the applicant in writing. The Office will not hear oral argument in support of a first request for reconsideration.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The refusal to register is subject to <i>de novo</i> review, which means that the Office will take a fresh look at whether the work meets the statutory requirements for copyright registration.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If the Office decides to register the work, it will notify the applicant in writing. This notification will be sent to the individual who submitted the first request for reconsideration, rather than the correspondent listed in the application. A certificate of registration will be sent separately to the mailing address specified in the application. See Chapter 600, Section 622.4.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If the Office upholds the refusal to register, it will notify the applicant in writing and will explain the reasons for its decision. This notification will be sent to the individual who submitted the first request for reconsideration.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Office will respond to the first request within four months after the date that the first request was received. If the deadline falls on a weekend or a federal holiday, the deadline will be extended to the next federal work day. In no case shall a failure to respond within four months after the date that the first request was received result in the registration of the applicant’s work.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>A second request for reconsideration must be in writing. The request should specify the reasons that the applicant believes that registration was improperly refused, including any legal arguments or supplementary information that support the applicant’s position. The applicant must specifically address the Office’s reasons for upholding the refusal to register following the applicant’s first request for reconsideration.

            <paragraph>The second appeal will be reviewed by the Review Board. The Review Board consists of the Register of Copyrights and the General Counsel of the U.S. Copyright Office (or their respective designees) and a third individual designated by the Register. <ref source="CFR" title="37" part="202" section="5" subsection="f" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.5(f)">37 C.F.R. § 202.5(f)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Review Board will base its decision on the applicant’s written submission and the administrative record. Specifically, the Board will consider the arguments and evidence set forth in the applicant’s second request for reconsideration, as well as the application and the deposit copy(ies). In addition, the Board may consider any prior correspondence between the applicant and the Office, or may take administrative notice of matters of general knowledge or matters known to the Office or the Review Board. If the Board needs additional information to review the second request, it will notify the applicant in writing. The Review Board will not hear oral argument on a second request for reconsideration.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Both the decision made by the registration specialist and the decision to uphold the refusal to register following the applicant’s first request for reconsideration are subject to <i>de novo</i> review, which means that the Board will take a fresh look at whether the work meets the statutory requirements for copyright registration.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>A majority of the Review Board’s members must agree to uphold or reverse a refusal to register. A decision issued by the Review Board has no precedential value, nor is any decision binding upon the Board in any other appeal.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If the Review Board decides to register the applicant’s work, it will notify the applicant in writing. This notification will be sent to the individual who submitted the second request for reconsideration, and the certificate of registration will be sent separately to the mailing address specified in the application. See Chapter 600, Section 622.4.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If the Review Board decides to uphold the refusal to register, it will notify the applicant in writing and will explain the reasons for its decision. This notification will be sent to the individual who submitted the second request for reconsideration. If the Review Board has been notified that the work is involved in litigation, the Review Board will send a copy of its decision to counsel of record for the parties in that dispute.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>If the U.S. Copyright Office registers a work following a first or second request for reconsideration, the Office will assign a registration decision date and an effective date of registration (“EDR”) to the registration.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The “registration decision date” is the date that the Office completed its examination and approved the claim after reviewing the applicant’s first or second request for reconsideration. The “effective date of registration” is the day on which the Office received an acceptable application, deposit copy(ies), and filing fee, which were later determined to be acceptable for registration. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="410" subsection="d" cite="17 U.S.C. § 410(d)">17 U.S.C. § 410(d)</ref>.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>As a general rule, if the applicant made a reasonable, good faith effort to complete the relevant fields/spaces in the application, the effective date of registration is the date that the Office received the application, provided that the applicant submitted the appropriate deposit copy(ies) and paid the applicable filing fee as of that date.

        <paragraph>If the U.S. Copyright Office upholds the refusal to register following a request for reconsideration, an applicant may appeal that decision under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) by instituting a judicial action against the Register of Copyrights in federal district court. See <ref source="USC" title="5" section="500" cite="5 U.S.C. § 500 et seq.">5 U.S.C. § 500 <i>et seq</i>.</ref></paragraph>
        <paragraph>An applicant does not need to appeal a refusal to register under the APA in order to institute an infringement action in federal district court. See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="411" subsection="a" cite="17 U.S.C. § 411(a)">17 U.S.C. § 411(a)</ref>. However, the applicant must serve a copy of the infringement complaint on the Register, and “[t]he Register may, at his or her option, become a party to the action with respect to the issue of registrability of the copyright claim by entering an appearance within sixty days after such service ….” Id.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>A second request for reconsideration must be postmarked or dispatched by a commercial carrier, courier, or messenger no later than three months from the date that appears in the written notice from the Office of its decision to uphold the refusal to register following the applicant’s first request for reconsideration. <ref source="CFR" title="37" part="202" section="5" subsection="c" paragraph="3" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.5(c)(3)">37 C.F.R. § 202.5(c)(3)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Office will not consider a second request for reconsideration if the applicant failed to submit the first request in a timely manner.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If the deadline for submitting a first or second request falls on a weekend or a federal holiday, the deadline will be extended until the next federal work day. See <ref source="CFR" title="37" part="202" section="5" subsection="b" paragraph="3" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.5(b)(3)">37 C.F.R. § 202.5(b)(3)</ref>, <ref source="CFR" title="37" part="202" section="5" subsection="c" paragraph="3" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.5(c)(3)">(c)(3)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The deadline for submitting a first or second request may be suspended or waived, in whole or in part, by the Register of Copyrights upon a showing of good cause. The request for a suspension or waiver should be made in writing, it should indicate whether the request involves a “FIRST” or “SECOND” request for reconsideration, and it should be sent to the address specified in Section 1708.2. A suspension or waiver may be granted only with respect to a specific request for reconsideration, and shall not be considered in connection with any other request from that applicant or any other applicant. See <ref source="CFR" title="37" part="202" section="5" subsection="e" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.5(e)">37 C.F.R. § 202.5(e)</ref>.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>1708.4</num> Withdrawing a Request for Reconsideration</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>An applicant may submit a request to withdraw a first or second request for reconsideration at any time before the U.S. Copyright Office has issued its decision. The request should be made in writing, it should indicate whether the requested withdrawal involves a “FIRST” or “SECOND” request, and it should be sent to the address specified in Section 1708.2. The decision whether to approve or deny the request will be made at the discretion of the Office. The filing fee will not be refunded and the Office will not reinstate a request for reconsideration once it has been withdrawn.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>1708.5</num> Amending the Application During an Administrative Appeal</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>When evaluating a first or second request for reconsideration, the U.S. Copyright Office will focus on the type of authorship claimed in the application, such as “2-D artwork” or “text.” As a general rule, the Office will not consider any type of authorship that was not expressly claimed in the application when the claim was refused. That said, the Office may allow an applicant to amend the application during a first or second appeal if the failure to include this information was the result of an honest omission or mistake.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Example:</paragraph>
            <paragraph>An application is submitted for a children’s book titled <i>The Empty Piñata</i>. The work contains artwork and a <i>de minimis</i> amount of text, but the applicant only asserted a claim in “text.” The registration specialist refuses registration. On appeal, the applicant admits that the words are uncopyrightable, and states that the applicant inadvertently failed to include a claim in “2-d artwork.” The Office will uphold the refusal to register the claim in “text,” and will consider whether the artwork contains a sufficient amount of creative expression to support a registration.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>1708.6</num> No Expedited Review</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>Special handling is a procedure for expediting the examination of an application to register a claim to copyright or the recordation of a transfer or other document pertaining to copyright. The U.S. Copyright Office offers this service in certain circumstances where a copyright owner or other interested parties have a compelling reason for the expedited issuance of a certificate. As discussed in Chapter 600, Section 623.2, the Office will not grant a request for special handling in connection with a first or second request for reconsideration.</paragraph>
