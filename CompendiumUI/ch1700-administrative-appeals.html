      NOTE: The Orrin G.

To exercise these remedies, owners typically must file schedules with the U.S. Copyright Office listing their sound recordings and specifying the name of the rights owner, title, and featured artist for each recording.

      Review of the First Request for Reconsideration
     </subsection_title>
     <paragraph>
      The first request for reconsideration will be reviewed by a U.S. Copyright Office staff attorney in the Registration Program office who did not participate in the initial examination of the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claim">
       claim
      </a>
      . The Office will base its decision on the
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">
       applicant's
      </a>
      submission and the administrative record. If the Office needs additional information in order to make its decision, the staff attorney will notify the applicant in writing. The Office will not hear oral argument in support of a first request for reconsideration.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The refusal to register is subject to
      <i>
       de novo
      </i>
      review, which means that the Office will take a fresh look at whether the work meets the statutory requirements for copyright registration.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      If the Office decides to register the work, it will notify the applicant in writing. This notification will be sent to the individual who submitted the first request for reconsideration, rather than the correspondent listed in the application. A
      <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#certificate_of_registration">
       certificate of registration
      </a>
      will be sent separately to the mailing address specified in the application. See

       Chapter 600, Section 622.4
      </a>
      .
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      If the Office upholds the refusal to register, it will notify the applicant in writing and will explain the reasons for its decision. This notification will be sent to the individual who submitted the first request for reconsideration.
     </paragraph>
     <paragraph>
      The Office will respond to the first request within four months after the date that the first request was received. If the deadline falls on a weekend or a federal holiday, the deadline will be extended to the next federal work day. In no case shall a failure to respond within four months after the date that the first request was received result in the registration of the applicant's work.

      Amending the Application During an Administrative Appeal
     </subsection_title>
     <paragraph>
      When evaluating a first or second request for reconsideration, the U.S. Copyright Office will focus on the type of authorship claimed in the application, such as "2-D artwork" or "text." As a general rule, the Office will not consider any type of authorship that was not expressly claimed in the application when the claim was refused. That said, the Office may allow an applicant to amend the application during a first or second appeal if the failure to include this information was the result of an honest omission or mistake.

On appeal, the applicant admits that the words are uncopyrightable, and states that the applicant inadvertently failed to include a claim in “2-d artwork."
