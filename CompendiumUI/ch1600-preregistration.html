    <paragraph>This Chapter provides information on the U.S. Copyright Office's practices and procedures for <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#preregistration">preregistration</a>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A pregistration “allows the author of a work vulnerable to predistribution infringement to enforce her exclusive rights in court before obtaining [a] registration or refusal" from the Copyright Office. <ref source="case" id="Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com, LLC, 139 S. Ct. 881, 889 (2019)">Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. v. Wall-Street.com, LLC, 139 S. Ct. 881, 889 (2019)</ref>. This procedure is primarily intended to address situations where copyrighted works are “distributed illegally via the Internet BEFORE they are even made available for sale to the public [which] severely undercuts the ability of copyright holders to receive fair and adequate compensation for their works.” <ref source="cong-rec" id="151 CONG. REC. S495 (daily ed. Jan. 25, 2005)">151 CONG. REC. S495 (daily ed. Jan. 25, 2005)</ref> (statement of Sen. Hatch).</paragraph>

    <section_title><num>1602</num> What Is Preregistration?</section_title>
    <paragraph>In cases involving the infringement of a United States work, copyright registration is a prerequisite for filing an infringement action and for seeking an award of statutory damages and attorney's fees. See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101">17 U.S.C. §§ 101</a>, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411#a">411(a)</a>, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/412">412</a>. Often, copyright owners do not seek registration until the work has been completed and distributed to the public, which may limit the remedies that may be available in cases involving "prerelease" infringement. See <ref source="report" id="H.R. REP. NO. 109-33, pt. 1, at 4 (2005)">H.R. REP. NO. 109-33, pt. 1, at 4 (2005)</ref>, reprinted in, 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 220, 223.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To address this concern, Congress created <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#preregistration">preregistration</a> — a procedure that allows certain copyright owners to file an action for infringement and seek statutory damages and attorney's fees in cases where the work was infringed before the copyright owner completed the work and released it to the public. See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/408#f_1">17 U.S.C. § 408(f) (1)</a>-<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/408#f_2">(2)</a>; see also</paragraph>

    <paragraph>"If a copyright owner is preparing to distribute a work of a type vulnerable to predistribution infringement . . . the owner may apply for preregistration.” <ref source="case" id="Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp., 139 S. Ct. at 885">Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp., 139 S. Ct. at 885</ref>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A work of authorship must satisfy the following criteria to qualify for this option:</paragraph>
    <list>
      <item>The work must be a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#motion_picture">motion picture</a>; a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#sound_recording">sound recording</a>; a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#musical_composition">musical composition</a>; a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#literary_work">literary work</a> being prepared for <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#publication">publication</a> in book form; a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#computer_program">computer program</a>; a videogame; or a photograph that is intended to advertise or market a particular product or service;</item>
      <item>The work must be <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#copyrightable">copyrightable</a>;</item>

      <item>The work must be <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#unpublished">unpublished</a>; and</item>
      <item>The work must be in the process of being prepared for commercial distribution.</item>
    </list>
    <paragraph><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/37/202.16">37 C.F.R. § 202.16</a>. A work that satisfies all of these requirements is eligible for preregistration, regardless of whether it is intended to be distributed in a physical or electronic format. See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/37/202.16#b_3">37 C.F.R. § 202.16(b) (3)</a>; see also <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2005/07/22/05-14427/preregistration-of-certain-unpublished-copyright-claims">Preregistration of Certain Unpublished Copyright Claims, 70 Fed.

    <paragraph>If the work described in the application does not meet these requirements, the Office will reject the application. The Office typically receives fewer than 2,000 applications for preregistration each year (compared with more than half a million applications for registration), and the Office rejects many of these applications because the work is not eligible for this procedure.</paragraph>

      <subsection_title><num>1603.1</num> Works That Are Eligible for Preregistration</subsection_title>
      <paragraph>Congress directed the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#Register_of_Copyrights">Register of Copyrights</a> to issue <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#preregistration">preregistrations</a> for any work of authorship that falls within a class of works that has had a history of infringement prior to the authorized commercial distribution by the copyright owner. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/408#f_1">17 U.S.C. § 408(f)(1)</a>-<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/408#f_2">(2)</a>. The Office determined that there has been a substantial history of prerelease infringement involving the following classes of works:</paragraph>
      <list>
        <item>Motion pictures.</item>
        <item>Sound recordings.</item>
      </list>
      <page label="4"></page>
      <list>
        <item>Musical compositions.</item>
        <item>Literary works being prepared for <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#publication">publication</a> in book form.</item>
        <item>Computer programs (including videogames).</item>
        <item>Advertising or marketing photographs.</item>
      </list>
      <paragraph><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/37/202.16#b_1">37 C.F.R. § 202.16(b)(1)</a>. A work of authorship must fall within one or more of these classes to be eligible for preregistration. The Office will refuse an application for preregistration if the work does not appear to fall within any of these classes.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Examples:</paragraph>
      <list>
        <item>The U.S. Copyright Office will accept an application to preregister a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#motion_picture">motion picture</a>. However, the Office will refuse to preregister a treatment, screenplay, storyboard, or shooting script for a motion picture because these types of works do not fit within the statutory definition of a "motion picture." See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101">17 U.S.C. § 101</a> (defining motion pictures as "<a href="/compendium/glossary.html#audiovisual_works">audiovisual works</a> consisting of a series of related images which, when shown in succession, impart an impression of motion, together with accompanying sounds, if any").</item>
        <item>As a general rule, a preregistration for a motion picture covers any sounds that may be embodied in that work (i.e., the soundtrack). However, the U.S. Copyright Office may question an application that asserts a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#claim">claim</a> in both a motion picture and a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#sound_recording">sound recording</a>, because the soundtrack for a motion picture does not fit within the statutory definition of a “sound recording." See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101">17 U.S.C. § 101</a> (defining sound recordings as "works that result from the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#fixation">fixation</a> of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, but not including the sounds accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work ...").</item>
        <item>A work of fiction or nonfiction that is intended to be published in book form (i.e., hardback books, paperback books, ebooks, and the like) may be eligible for preregistration, even if the work contains material that would be ineligible for preregistration on its own, such as drawings, illustrations, or other two-dimensional artwork.</item>
        <item>A work of fiction or nonfiction that is intended to be published in book form may be eligible for preregistration, even if the work will be published exclusively online. However, the U.S. Copyright Office will not accept an application to preregister a website, because websites are not published in "book form."</item>
        <item>A personal journal or a daily diary would be considered a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#literary_work">literary work</a>, but these types of works are not eligible for preregistration, because in most cases, they are not intended to be published, nor</item>
      </list>
      <page label="5"></page>
      <list>
        <item>are they intended for commercial distribution. See Sections <a href="#subsec-1603-4">1603.4</a> and <a href="#subsec-1603-5">1603.5</a>.</item>
        <item>The U.S. Copyright Office will accept an application to preregister a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#computer_program">computer program</a> that is intended for commercial distribution. However, the Office will refuse to preregister a claim in the HTML code for a website, because HTML code is a markup language rather than a computer programming language, and thus coding in HTML generally does not result in a computer program.</item>
        <item>A photograph that is intended to advertise or market a particular product or service may be eligible for preregistration, but a family portrait or a photograph taken on a personal vacation would not.</item>
        <item>A photograph of a famous celebrity caught in an embarrassing situation would not be eligible for preregistration, because this type of work does not advertise or market a particular product or service.</item>
      </list>

In addition, "offering to distribute copies or phonorecords to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution, public performance, or public display, constitutes publication."

      <paragraph>A <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#preregistration">preregistration</a> is merely a placeholder for or a prelude to an actual registration. Specifically, a preregistration allows a copyright owner to institute an infringement action "before the Register has granted or refused registration" if: (i) the work has been preregistered prior to <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#publication">publication</a>, and (ii) the work is registered within three months after its first publication. <ref source="case" id="Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp., 139 S.

      <page label="7"></page>
      <paragraph>an infringement occurred within two months after the first publication of the work, the application, deposit, and filing fee must be received in proper form within one month after the copyright owner learned of the infringement or within three months after the first publication of the work (whichever is earlier). See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/408#f_3">17 U.S.C. §§ 408(f)(3)</a>, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411#a">411(a)</a>, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/412">412</a>.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>If a preregistered work is not registered within the prescribed time period, a district court must dismiss any action involving an infringement that occurred before or within two months after the first publication of that work. See <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/408#f_4">17 U.S.C. § 408(f)(4)</a>. If the infringement began more than two months after the first publication of a preregistered work, this rule does not apply. In other words, the failure to register a preregistered work before the deadline specified in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/408#f_4_A">Sections 408(f) (4) (A)</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/408#f_4_B">(B)</a> of the Copyright Act will not prevent a copyright owner from registering that work and pursuing an infringement action, provided that the infringement occurred more than two months after the first publication of that work.

      <paragraph>A <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#preregistration">preregistration</a> is not a registration. Nor is it a substitute for a registration. It “serves only as a preliminary step prior to a full registration.” <ref source="case" id="Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. 139 S. Ct. at 888">Fourth Estate Public Benefit Corp. 139 S. Ct. at 888</ref> (internal quotation omitted).</paragraph>
      <paragraph>As discussed in Section <a href="#subsec-1604-1">1604.1</a>, preregistration allows certain copyright owners to satisfy the requirements of Sections <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411#a">411(a)</a> and <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/412">412</a> of the Copyright Act by notifying the U.S. Copyright Office that the work is being prepared for commercial distribution. Copyright owners may benefit from this procedure if they have started to create a work of authorship that has not yet been completed, and if it is likely that a third party may infringe that work before it has been released to the public. But to preserve the benefits of this procedure, the copyright owner must seek an actual registration for the work promptly after it has been published or infringed. See id. at 888.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>There are certain features that preregistration does not possess. Unlike a registration, a preregistration does not constitute prima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright or the facts stated in the application for preregistration or in the notification of preregistration. Moreover, the fact that a work has been preregistered does not create any presumption that the Office will register the work if the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">applicant</a> subsequently submits an application for registration. <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/37/202.16#c_13">37 C.F.R. § 202.16(c)(13)</a>; see also <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2005/07/22/05-14427/preregistration-of-certain-unpublished-copyright-claims">Preregistration of Certain Unpublished Copyright Claims, 70 Fed. Reg. 42,286, 42,286, 42,289-90 (July 22, 2005)</a>.</paragraph>
      <paragraph>Preregistration is neither a prerequisite nor a precondition for copyright owners who wish to register their works with the Office. In other words, an original work of authorship may be registered regardless of whether that work has been preregistered or not.</paragraph>

    <section_title><num>1612</num> No Corrections or Cancellations</section_title>
    <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office conducts only a limited review of an application for <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#preregistration">preregistration</a>, because a preregistration does not constitute <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#prima_facie">prima facie</a> evidence of the validity of the copyright or the facts stated in the notification of preregistration. Consequently, a preregistration will not be cancelled, corrected, supplemented, or amended once it has been entered in the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#public_record">public record</a>. For example, the Office will not expunge a preregistration from its records if the <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#applicant">applicant</a> incorrectly described the work or made other errors in the application. Nor will the Office accept an application for a <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#supplementary_registration">supplementary registration</a> to correct or amplify the information in the preregistration record. See <a href="/compendium/ch1800-post-registration.html">Chapter 1800</a>, <a href="/compendium/ch1800-post-registration.html#subsec-1802-4">Section 1802.4</a>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>To correct a preregistration record, the applicant may submit another application containing the corrected or omitted information. The new effective date of preregistration is the day on which the Office receives the new <a href="/compendium/glossary.html#filing_fee">filing fee</a> and the new application, which are later determined by the U.S. Copyright Office or a court of competent jurisdiction to be acceptable for preregistration. See <a href="#sec-1609">Section 1609</a>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>If the work has been completed, the applicant may submit an application for a basic registration that contains the correct or missing information, instead of submitting a new application for a new preregistration.</paragraph>
