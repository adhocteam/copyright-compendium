            <subsection_title><num>1402.1</num> Statutory Basis for the Application</subsection_title>
            <paragraph><ref source="USC" title="17" section="408(a)" cite="Section 408(a) of the Copyright Act">Section 408(a) of the Copyright Act</ref> provides that a copyright owner or the owner of any of the exclusive rights in a work may seek a registration by delivering an application, filing fee, and an appropriate deposit to the U.S. Copyright Office. The Copyright Act gives the Register of Copyrights the authority to establish administrative classes of works for registration, to create application forms, and to specify the information that should be included in the application. See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408(a), 408(c)(1), 409, 702" cite="17 U.S.C. §§ 408(a), 408(c)(1), 409, 702">17 U.S.C. §§ 408(a), 408(c)(1), 409, 702</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Pursuant to this authority, the U.S. Copyright Office has created five administrative classes for purposes of registration, namely, nondramatic literary works (Class TX), works of the visual arts (Class VA), works of the performing arts (Class PA), sound recordings (Class SR), and serials (Class SE). The Office has created different versions of its online application and paper applications for each class of works. Registration is administered by the Office’s Registration Program, which includes three divisions: Literary, Performing Arts, and Visual Arts. Applications are assigned to one of these divisions, depending on the classification of the work.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>NOTE: The administrative classes are solely for administrative purposes, and they have no bearing on the substantive subject matter of copyright or the exclusive rights provided by the copyright law. See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408(c)(1)" cite="17 U.S.C. § 408(c)(1)">17 U.S.C. § 408(c)(1)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Applicants should use the form that is most appropriate for the type of work being registered. If the work contains more than one type of authorship, applicants should use the form that corresponds to the predominant type of copyrightable authorship in that work. For example, if the claim involves a children’s book that includes both text and illustrations, the applicant should use the application that corresponds to the predominant form of authorship in the book. If the book contains only a few illustrations, the applicant should use the appropriate application for a Literary Work. If the book mostly contains illustrations with a small amount of text, the applicant should use the appropriate application for a Work of the Visual Arts. If the types of authorship are roughly equal, the applicant may use the application that would be appropriate for either type of authorship. See <ref source="CFR" title="37" section="202.3(b)(2)(iii)" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.3(b)(2)(iii)">37 C.F.R. § 202.3(b)(2)(iii)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>NOTE: When registering a sound recording, the applicant must use the appropriate application for sound recording authorship, regardless of whether the sound recording is the predominant form of authorship in the work. See id.</paragraph>

            <paragraph><ref source="USC" title="17" section="409" cite="Section 409 of the Copyright Act">Section 409 of the Copyright Act</ref> states that “[t]he application for copyright registration shall be made on a form prescribed by the Register of Copyrights.” <ref source="USC" title="17" section="409" cite="17 U.S.C. § 409">17 U.S.C. § 409</ref>. Although the Register of Copyrights has been given discretion in how to organize and establish the requirements for the Standard Application and paper applications (which are discussed in Sections 1403 and 1404 below), Section 409 also sets forth certain elements that must be contained in these forms:</paragraph>
            <list>
                <item>1. The name and address of the copyright claimant;</item>
                <item>2. In the case of a work other than an anonymous or pseudonymous work, the name and nationality or domicile of the author or authors, and, if one or more of the authors is dead, the dates of their deaths;</item>
                <item>3. If the work is anonymous or pseudonymous, the nationality or domicile of the author or authors;</item>
                <item>4. In the case of a work made for hire, a statement to this effect;</item>
                <item>5. If the copyright claimant is not the author, a brief statement of how the claimant obtained ownership of the copyright;</item>
                <item>6. The title of the work, together with any previous or alternative titles under which the work can be identified;</item>
                <item>7. The year in which creation of the work was completed;</item>
                <item>8. If the work has been published, the date and nation of its first publication; and</item>
                <item>9. In the case of a compilation or derivative work, an identification of any preexisting work or works that it is based on or incorporates, and a brief, general statement of the additional material covered by the copyright claim being registered.</item>
            </list>
            <paragraph><ref source="USC" title="17" section="409(1-9)" cite="17 U.S.C. § 409(1-9)">17 U.S.C. § 409(1-9)</ref>. The statute also allows the Register to request additional information in the application. Specifically, it grants the Register broad authority to require “any other information [that] bear[s] upon the preparation or identification of the work or the existence, ownership, or duration of the copyright.” Id. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="409(10)" cite="§ 409(10)">§ 409(10)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Office offers other applications that request some — but not all — of the information listed in Section 409, such as the Single Application (which is discussed in Section 1405). These specialized forms do not request all of the information listed in Section 409, because in order to use them certain types of information cannot be present in the claim. For example, an applicant cannot use the Single Application to register a work created by an individual author who transferred his or her copyright to another party. Thus, there is no need to request “a brief statement of how the claimant obtained ownership of the copyright” in this form.</paragraph>
            <paragraph><ref source="USC" title="17" section="408(c)(1)" cite="Section 408(c)(1) of the Copyright Act">Section 408(c)(1) of the Copyright Act</ref> authorizes the Register to establish an administrative procedure for registering a group of related of works. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408(d)" cite="Section 408(d)">Section 408(d)</ref> authorizes the Register to establish a procedure for issuing a supplementary registration to correct or amplify the information given in an existing registration. And <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408(f)(1)" cite="Section 408(f)(1)">Section 408(f)(1)</ref> authorizes the Register to establish a procedure for issuing a preregistration for unpublished works that are being prepared for commercial distribution.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Congress gave the Register the discretion to develop an appropriate application for these types of records. See <ref source="USC" title="17" section="408(c)(1), (d), (f)(1)" cite="17 U.S.C. § 408(c)(1), (d), (f)(1)">17 U.S.C. § 408(c)(1), (d), (f)(1)</ref>. The specific requirements for the various group registration options that the Office currently offers are discussed in Chapter 1100, the requirements for a supplementary registration are discussed in Chapter 1800, and the requirements for preregistration are discussed in Chapter 1600.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office offers the types of applications described below. An applicant should choose an appropriate application based on whether he or she is seeking a basic registration, a group registration, a supplementary registration, a renewal registration, a GATT registration, or a preregistration. For a definition and discussion of each type of record, see Chapter 200, Section 202.1.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>An application for a basic registration covers a work of authorship created or first published on or after January 1, 1978 or an unpublished work created prior to January 1, 1978 and still protected by copyright.

        <section_title><num>1403</num> The Standard Application</section_title>
        <paragraph>The Standard Application is an online form that may be submitted through the U.S. Copyright Office’s electronic registration system. For specific information on how to complete the various fields in this application, see Chapter 600.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The Office offers different versions of this application, which may be used to register for the following types of works:</paragraph>
        <list>
            <item>Literary works include nondramatic literary works, such as fiction, nonfiction, poetry, an individual article, a textbook, a reference work, a directory, a catalog, advertising copy, a compilation of information, a computer program, a textual work made available online, or a database.</item>
            <item>Works of the visual arts include pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, such as two-dimensional or three-dimensional works of fine, graphic, or applied art, photographs, prints, art reproductions, maps, technical drawings, or architectural works.</item>
            <item>Works of the performing arts include musical works (either with or without lyrics), dramatic works (such as a screenplay, play, or other script), pantomimes, and choreographic works.</item>
            <item>Sound recordings are works that contain sound recording authorship. An applicant must select the option for “sound recording” if he or she intends to register that element of the work with the Standard Application (even if the work also contains other types of authorship, such as music or lyrics). If the applicant does not intend to register sound recording authorship, the work should be registered using the form that would be appropriate for the predominant type of copyrightable authorship in that work (even if it happens to contain one or more sound recordings). Likewise, the applicant should not select the option for “sound recording” if the applicant intends to register the sounds accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work.</item>
            <item>NOTE: The Office only registers sound recordings that were fixed on or after February 15, 1972. For information concerning this issue, see Chapter 800, Section 803.5(D).</item>
            <item>Motion picture/audiovisual works include feature films, documentary films, animated films, television shows, videos, videogames, or other audiovisual works, such as slide presentations. This category also applies if the applicant intends to register the sounds that accompany a motion picture or other audiovisual work.</item>
            <item>Single serial issue refers to a single issue of a serial publication (e.g., a single issue of a magazine, a single volume of a journal, etc.). The Standard Application also may be used to register a single serial issue together with the individual contributions appearing within that issue, if they are fully owned by the claimant when the claim is submitted, and if they have not been published or registered before. If the applicant intends to register an individual contribution, but does not intend to register the issue as a whole, the applicant should use the appropriate form for a “Literary Work” or a “Work of the Visual Arts.” For a detailed discussion of single issue serials, see Chapter 700, Section 712.</item>
        </list>
        <paragraph>The Standard Application may not be used to seek a supplementary registration, a renewal registration, or a registration for a restored work, a mask work, or a vessel design. See <ref source="FEDREG" volume="83" page="5227, 5229" date="2018-02-06" cite="Streamlining the Single Application and Clarifying Eligibility Requirements, 83 Fed.

        <paragraph>Likewise, this form may not be used to register a group of related works, unless it is expressly permitted under the Office’s regulations. Specifically, the Standard Application may be used to register a group of secure test items. <ref source="CFR" title="37" section="202.13(c)(1)" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.13(c)(1)">37 C.F.R. § 202.13(c)(1)</ref>. It also may be used to register a group of updates or revisions to a photographic database, but only if the applicant has obtained prior authorization from the Visual Arts Division. See id. <ref source="CFR" title="37" section="202.3(b)(5)(ii)(A)" cite="§ 202.3(b)(5)(ii)(A)">§ 202.3(b)(5)(ii)(A)</ref>.</paragraph>

        <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office strongly encourages applicants to use the Standard Application rather than a paper application. Claims submitted through the electronic registration system can be examined more quickly and efficiently, and as a result, the Office charges a lower filing fee for the Standard Application. However, the Office will accept paper applications for claims involving the following types of works:</paragraph>
        <list>
            <item>Form TX may be used to seek a basic registration for a nondramatic literary work, such as fiction, nonfiction, poetry, an individual article, a textbook, a reference work, a directory, a catalog, advertising copy, a compilation of information, a computer program, textual works made available online, or a database.</item>
            <item>Form VA may be used to seek a basic registration for a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, including two-dimensional or three-dimensional works of fine, graphic, and applied art, photographs, print or art reproductions, maps, and technical drawings.</item>
            <item>NOTE: A paper application may not be used to register an architectural work. To register this type of work, applicants must use the Standard Application.</item>
            <item>Form PA may be used to register musical works (either with or without lyrics), dramatic works (such as a screenplay, play, or other script), pantomimes, choreographic works, or motion pictures and other audiovisual works (such as feature films, documentary films, animated films, television shows, videos, or videogames).</item>
            <item>Form SR must be used if the applicant intends to register sound recording authorship with a paper application, even if the work contains additional types of authorship, such as music or lyrics. If the applicant does not intend to register a sound recording, Form SR should not be used (even if the work contains one or more sound recordings). Likewise, the applicant should not use Form SR if the applicant intends to register the sounds accompanying a motion picture or other audiovisual work.</item>
            <item>NOTE: The Office only registers sound recordings that were fixed on or after February 15, 1972. For information concerning this issue, see Chapter 800, Section 803.5(D).</item>
            <item>Form SE may be used to register a single issue of a serial publication (e.g., magazines, journals). This form also may be used to register a serial together with the individual contributions appearing within that issue, if they are fully owned by the claimant when the claim is submitted, and if they have not been published or registered before. If the applicant only intends to register an individual contribution with a paper application, the applicant should use Form TX, Form VA, or Form PA instead of Form SE. For a detailed discussion of single issue serials, see Chapter 700, Section 712.</item>
            <item>Form MW must be used to register a claim in a mask work that is fixed in a semiconductor chip product by or under the authority of the owner of the mask work. A mask work is a series of related images, however fixed or encoded, having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor chip product, and in which the relation of the images to one another is such that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip product. For more information on mask works, see Chapter 1200.</item>
            <item>Form D-VH must be used to register a claim in a vessel design. These forms apply only to water crafts that are designed and capable of (i) independently steering a course on or through water by themselves or via propulsion, and (ii) transporting one or more passengers. For more information on vessel designs, see Chapter 1300.</item>
        </list>
        <paragraph>When preparing a paper application applicants must use the official forms that are provided by the Office. The information provided on the application must be legible and should be typewritten or printed in black ink. If an applicant needs more space, he or she may provide additional information with a continuation sheet submitted on Form CON.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>The applications listed above may not be used to seek a supplementary registration, a renewal registration, or a registration for a restored work. See <ref source="FEDREG" volume="83" page="5227, 5229" date="2018-02-06" cite="Streamlining the Single Application and Clarifying Eligibility Requirements, 83 Fed.

        <paragraph>Likewise, these forms may not be used to register a group of related works, unless it is expressly permitted under the Office’s regulations. Specifically, Form VA may be used to register a group of updates or revisions to a photographic database, and Form TX must be used to register a group of updates or revisions to any other type of database. See id. <ref source="CFR" title="37" section="202.3(b)(5)(ii)(A)" cite="§ 202.3(b)(5)(ii)(A)">§ 202.3(b)(5)(ii)(A)</ref>.</paragraph>

        <section_title><num>1405</num> The Single Application</section_title>
        <paragraph>The Single Application is an online form designed for authors who file the simplest kind of claims. The U.S. Copyright Office charges a lower filing fee for this application, which is intended to benefit individual creators and encourage them to register their works.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>This application may be used to register one work by one author that is solely owned by that individual. It also may be used to register one sound recording and one musical work, literary work, or dramatic work if certain requirements have been met. For detailed information concerning these requirements see Sections 1405.1 through 1405.7 below.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>If the Office determines that a particular work does not satisfy these requirements, it will refuse registration and instruct the applicant to resubmit the claim using the Standard Application. If the applicant wishes to proceed with the claim, he or she must submit a new application, filing fee, and another copy or phonorecord of the work. The effective date of registration will be based on the date that the new submission is received by the Office.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>To access the Single Application, the applicant must log into the electronic registration system and select the link designated for claims involving “one work by one author.”</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Before proceeding with this form, the applicant must confirm that he or she has read and understood the eligibility requirements that govern the Single Application. For guidance on how to complete the various fields in this application, applicants should consult <ref source="OTHER" type="Circular" number="11" cite="Using the Single Application (Circular 11)">Using the Single Application (Circular 11)</ref> and the help text that accompanies this form.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>A Single Application may be certified and submitted by the individual who created the work. But the U.S. Copyright Office recognizes that many authors are not familiar with the electronic registration system, and some individual creators may prefer to have an authorized agent submit the application on their behalf. Therefore, the Office will accept an application that has been certified and submitted by a duly authorized agent, provided that the agent is identified in the Correspondent section of the form. See <ref source="CFR" title="37" section="202.3(c)(1), (3)(i)" cite="37 C.F.R. § 202.3(c)(1), (3)(i)">37 C.F.R. § 202.3(c)(1), (3)(i)</ref>. If the Office determines that a third party filed a Single Application, but failed to identify itself in the form, the Office will refuse to register the claim.

            <paragraph>As a general rule, the Single Application may be used to register only one work by one author, but there is a limited exception for sound recordings.

            <list>
                <item>The author of the sound recording and the work embodied in that recording must be the same individual.</item>

            <paragraph>Applicants may not use the Single Application if the deposit contains material created by two or more authors (even if they only intend to register material created by one of those individuals). For the same reason, this application may not be used to register a derivative work based on a preexisting work by a different author.

        <paragraph>As discussed above, applicants must use an online application to register an architectural work, a group of unpublished works, a group of photographs, a group of serials or newsletters, a group of contributions to periodicals, or a group of short online literary works. In most cases, applicants must use the online application to correct or amplify the information appearing in an existing registration. See Sections 1404, 1406.1, 1406.2, 1406.4, 1406.5, and 1407.</paragraph>
        <paragraph>In exceptional cases, the U.S. Copyright Office may waive this online filing requirement, subject to such conditions that the Associate Register of Copyrights and Director of the Office of Registration Policy and Practice may impose on the applicant. An applicant may submit a request to waive this requirement in writing. It should explain why the applicant is unable to use the online application, and it should be sent to the following address:</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>1412.1</num> Statutory Basis for Setting Filing Fees</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>Since 1997, the U.S. Copyright Office has undertaken a series of studies to determine what fees to charge for specific services relating to registration. The Office revisits its schedule of fees approximately every three years, a process during which it seeks public comment, adopts some fees, and makes recommendations for other fees to Congress.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The majority of the Office’s fee adjustments are guided by <ref source="USC" title="17" section="708(b)" cite="Section 708(b) of the Copyright Act">Section 708(b) of the Copyright Act</ref>, which states that, before adjusting certain fees, the Register must conduct a study of the Office’s costs for registering claims and must consider the timing of any fee adjustments and the Office’s authority to use the fees consistent with the Office’s budget. <ref source="USC" title="17" section="708(b)" cite="Section 708(b)">Section 708(b)</ref> also states that the Register may, based on the results of the fee study, adjust some fees “not more than necessary to cover the reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office for … services … plus a reasonable inflation adjustment to account for any estimated increase in costs.” Finally, <ref source="USC" title="17" section="708(b)" cite="Section 708(b)">Section 708(b)</ref> mandates that certain fees “shall be fair and equitable and give due consideration to the objectives of the copyright system.”</paragraph>

            <paragraph>When filing claims via the U.S. Copyright Office’s electronic registration system, the applicant will be prompted to provide payment on the Online Payment screen. Applicants who submit paper applications should provide a deposit account number in the appropriate space of the application or should submit the filing fees in the same envelope or package with the application and deposit copy(ies). For more specific information regarding deposit accounts, see Section 1412.5 below.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>1412.4</num> Acceptable Forms of Payment</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office has issued regulations regarding acceptable forms of payment for filing fees. See <ref source="CFR" title="37" section="201.6(a)" cite="37 C.F.R. § 201.6(a)">37 C.F.R. § 201.6(a)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Applicants using the Office’s online registration system to file applications may pay fees by making a secure payment by credit or debit card, electronic check, or U.S. Copyright Office deposit account.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Applicants submitting paper applications may pay fees from a deposit account or by using checks, money orders, or bank drafts payable to the U.S. Copyright Office. Payment in cash may be made only in person at the Public Information Office.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Fees paid from a foreign country should be in the form of an international money order or bank check payable and immediately negotiable in the United States for the full amount of the fee required. All foreign checks or money orders must be redeemable without a service or exchange fee through a U.S. institution, payable in U.S. dollars, and imprinted with American Banking Association routing numbers. See id.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Postal money orders and international money orders that are negotiable only at a post office are not acceptable. Uncertified checks are accepted subject to collection. Where the statutory fee is submitted in the form of a check, the registration of the copyright claim or other record made by the Office is provisional until payment is received.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Receipt of valid fees is very important because it affects the effective date and validity of a registration. The effective date of registration will be the date the valid payment is received, provided that the applicant satisfied the minimum requirements for an acceptable application and deposit copy(ies) as of that date. In the event the filing fee is not paid, the registration or other record shall be expunged.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>1412.5</num> Deposit Accounts</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office maintains a system of deposit accounts for the convenience of those who frequently use the Office’s services. The system allows an individual or firm to establish a deposit account with the Office and to make advance deposits into the account. Charges for registration, recordation, or other fee services will be deducted from the outstanding balance in such accounts. See <ref source="CFR" title="37" section="201.6(b)" cite="37 C.F.R § 201.6(b)">37 C.F.R § 201.6(b)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Only certain applicants may take advantage of deposit accounts. Specifically, a person or entity must have twelve or more transactions a year with the Office before they may prepay copyright expenses by establishing a deposit account. The Office and the deposit account holder will cooperatively determine an appropriate minimum balance for the deposit account (in no case less than $450), and the Office will automatically notify the deposit account holder if the account falls below that balance.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>Deposit account holders may take measures to protect against falling below the account minimum. The holder may authorize the Office to automatically replenish the account from the holder’s bank account or credit card in an amount determined by the deposit account holder. Automatic replenishment will be triggered when the deposit account falls below the minimum level of funding. The Office will notify the account holder when its account will be replenished.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Office will close a deposit account the second time an account holder overdraws the account within any twelve-month period. An account closed for this reason can be reopened only if the account holder agrees to fund the account through automatic replenishment.</paragraph>

            <subsection_title><num>1412.6</num> Refunds</subsection_title>
            <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office will not refund fees submitted for applications for basic, supplementary, or renewal registration, including mask works and vessel designs, if the Office refuses to register the claim because the material deposited does not constitute copyrightable subject matter or because the claim is invalid for any other reason. The Office will refund payments made by mistake or in excess of the fee, depending upon the timing of the request or other factors, but amounts of $50 or less will not be refunded unless specifically requested. See <ref source="CFR" title="37" section="201.6(c)(1)" cite="37 C.F.R. § 201.6(c)(1)">37 C.F.R. § 201.6(c)(1)</ref>. For example, the Office may refund the filing fee for a duplicate submission if the applicant filed an online application, and then immediately submitted another application to register the same work because her computer crashed before she received an email acknowledging her first submission. By contrast, if the applicant submitted an application for a preregistration, a supplementary registration, or a renewal registration, the Office will not refund the filing fee, even if she actually intended to file an application for a basic registration.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>When a check received in payment of the filing fee is returned to the U.S. Copyright Office marked “insufficient funds” or is otherwise marked uncollectible, the Office may cancel any registration for which the dishonored check was submitted. <ref source="CFR" title="37" section="201.7(c)(2)" cite="37 C.F.R. § 201.7(c)(2)">37 C.F.R. § 201.7(c)(2)</ref>.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The Office will notify an applicant in writing if the check could not be collected. If the filing fee is received within forty-five days from the date set forth in the notice, the Office will issue a new certificate of registration. The effective date of registration for the new certificate will be the date that the filing fee was received.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>If the Office does not receive a filing fee within forty-five days, the Office will cancel the registration. If the applicant would like to resubmit the work for registration, the applicant should file a new application, together with new deposit copy(ies) and the correct filing fee. In appropriate cases, the Office reserves the right to require a certified check or money order, and in all cases, the effective date of registration will be based on the date that the new submission is received by the Office.</paragraph>

            <paragraph>The U.S. Copyright Office offers expedited handling of applications and documents, as well as requests for searches, certifications, or other services. The Office charges an additional fee for expedited services, called a special handling fee. The current fees for these services are set forth in the Office’s regulations at <ref source="CFR" title="37" section="201.3(d)" cite="37 C.F.R. § 201.3(d)">37 C.F.R. § 201.3(d)</ref>, and on its website under the heading “Special services.” For detailed information on these fees, see Chapter 600, Section 623.6 and Chapter 2400, Section 2411.3.</paragraph>
            <paragraph>The special handling fee must be paid for each application, each document, or other service for which expedited service is requested and granted. Once a request for special handling has been granted, the special handling fee is not refundable, regardless of whether the Office issues a certificate of registration or a certificate of recordation or refuses to register or refuses to record the document.</paragraph>
