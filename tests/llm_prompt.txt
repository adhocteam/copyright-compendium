You are reviewing a quality check between a PDF document and its HTML conversion for the U.S. Copyright Office Compendium of Practices, Third Edition.

Given the original PDF text and the converted HTML text for the same chapter, identify any text discrepancies. For each discrepancy, classify it as:

- HIGH: Substantive text changes that could affect legal meaning or accuracy. Examples: missing/added sentences or paragraphs, changed section numbers (e.g. 808.10(I)(2) → 808.10(H)(2)), altered legal citations, changed statutory references, or any change that alters the meaning of the text.
- MEDIUM: Possible issues that warrant review but may be acceptable. Examples: missing terminal punctuation on citations (trailing periods), small word changes, spacing differences in parenthetical references like "copy (ies)" vs "copy(ies)".
- LOW: Expected conversion artifacts that are known intentional changes. Examples: PDF headers/footers removed, TOC page numbers omitted, hyperlinks added, whitespace normalization, case normalization like "NO." → "No.", line-break hyphenation differences.

Output ONLY a JSON array of objects. Each object must have exactly these fields:
- "severity": "HIGH" or "MEDIUM" or "LOW"
- "location": approximate section number or page reference where the discrepancy occurs
- "pdf_text": the relevant PDF text snippet (keep under 200 characters)
- "html_text": the corresponding HTML text snippet (keep under 200 characters)
- "description": brief description of what changed and why it matters

Ignore these known intentional changes entirely (do NOT include them in output):
- Removal of PDF headers ("COMPENDIUM OF U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE PRACTICES, Third Edition")
- Removal of PDF footers ("Chapter XXX : N MM/DD/YYYY")
- Removal of TOC page numbers and dot-leaders
- Addition of hyperlinks to sections, glossary terms, and external resources
- Addition of semantic HTML tags (<ref>, <cite>, <a>, etc.)
- Whitespace normalization between words

Focus on finding genuine text content differences that could indicate conversion errors.
