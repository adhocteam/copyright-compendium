# Content-Checking QA Engine

Automated quality assurance for the Copyright Compendium web conversion. Compares HTML content on the CompendiumUI website against the original PDF source text to catch conversion errors.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (from project root)
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt

# Run algorithmic check on a chapter
python -m tests.run_qa --algo --chapters ch200

# Run with full report output
python -m tests.run_qa --algo --chapters ch200 --format all --output-dir tests/reports
```

## How It Works

The engine has two comparison modes:

### Algorithmic Checker (`--algo`)

Uses character-level comparison on **space-stripped text** to find genuine content differences while ignoring whitespace artifacts from PDF extraction.

**Why space-stripped?** PDF text extraction commonly joins or splits words at line breaks (e.g., `ofthe` instead of `of the`, `pra ctices` instead of `practices`). By removing all whitespace before comparing, these artifacts become invisible — only real character-level content differences are reported.

The pipeline:
1. **Extract** text from HTML source files and pre-extracted PDF `.txt` files
2. **Normalize** both texts (Unicode normalization, PDF header/footer removal, bullet markers, word fragment rejoining)
3. **Strip** all whitespace from both texts
4. **Diff** the stripped texts character-by-character using `difflib.SequenceMatcher`
5. **Map** each character difference back to the original text for readable context
6. **Classify** each difference as HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW severity

### LLM Checker (`--llm`)

Uses Google Gemini API for semantic analysis. Sends both texts with a structured prompt that asks the model to identify and classify discrepancies. Requires a `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key python -m tests.run_qa --llm --chapters ch200
```

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Meaning | Examples |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **HIGH** | Substantive content change that may affect meaning | Changed section numbers, missing paragraphs, altered legal references |
| **MEDIUM** | Formatting difference worth noting | Section delimiters (`. 202`), punctuation changes, minor reference formatting |
| **LOW** | Expected artifact, safe to ignore | PDF headers/footers, TOC page numbers, whitespace-only differences |

## CLI Reference

```bash
python -m tests.run_qa [OPTIONS]

# Check mode (at least one required)
  --algo                Run algorithmic comparison
  --llm                 Run LLM-based semantic check
  --both                Run both checks

# Chapter selection (default: all mapped chapters)
  --chapters CH [CH...] Specific chapter IDs (e.g., ch200 ch800)
  --changed-files F [F...] Auto-detect chapters from changed HTML files

# Output
  --format {console,markdown,json,all}  Output format (default: console)
  --output-dir DIR      Directory for markdown/json reports
  --severity-filter {HIGH,MEDIUM,LOW}   Show only this severity and above
```

## Adding New Chapters

The chapter mapping lives in [`conftest.py`](conftest.py). To add a new chapter:

1. Ensure the HTML source file exists in `CompendiumUI/public/` (e.g., `ch300-copyrightable-authorship-src.html`)
2. Ensure the PDF `.txt` file exists in `copyright_compendium_pdfs/` (generated by `scripts/pdf_to_text.py`)
3. Add an entry to `CHAPTER_MAP` in `conftest.py`:

```python
"ch300": {
    "html": "ch300-copyrightable-authorship-src.html",
    "txt": "ch300-copyrightable-authorship.txt",
    "title": "Copyrightable Authorship",
},
```

## CI / GitHub Actions

A [GitHub Actions workflow](../.github/workflows/qa-content-check.yml) runs automatically on pushes to `main` that change HTML source files in `CompendiumUI/public/`. It:

1. Detects which chapters were modified
2. Runs the algorithmic checker on those chapters
3. Runs the LLM checker if the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` repository secret is set
4. Uploads reports as workflow artifacts
5. Posts a summary to the GitHub Actions run

The workflow also supports manual triggering via `workflow_dispatch`.
