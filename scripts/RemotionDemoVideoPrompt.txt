# Remotion Demo Video Prompt

Use this prompt to guide creation of a short demo video for a repository using Remotion, and to attach it to the README.

---

## Part 1: Setup Remotion

1. **Create a new Remotion project** (recommended for first-time use):
   ```bash
   npx create-video@latest
   ```
   - Choose the "Hello World" template for simplicity
   - Name the project (e.g., `demo-video` or `repo-demo`)
   - Or choose "Blank" if you want minimal scaffolding

2. **Alternative: Add Remotion to an existing project**:
   ```bash
   npm i remotion @remotion/cli @remotion/player
   ```
   Create a `remotion/` folder with:
   - `index.ts` – entry point that registers compositions
   - `Root.tsx` – lists your compositions
   - Your composition component (e.g., `DemoVideo.tsx`)

3. **Start the Remotion Studio** for preview and editing:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## Part 2: Demo Video Content Guidelines

Create a composition that showcases the repository in 30–90 seconds. Include:

### Opening (5–10 seconds)
- Repository/project name
- One-line tagline or value proposition
- Clean, readable typography (large font, high contrast)

### Core Demo (20–60 seconds)
- **For web apps**: Show the UI in action—key flows, navigation, main features
- **For CLI/tools**: Show terminal commands and output
- **For libraries**: Show code snippets and usage examples
- Use smooth transitions between scenes (fade, slide, or simple cuts)
- Keep each scene focused on one idea (3–8 seconds per scene)
- Avoid clutter; highlight 3–5 main features maximum

### Closing (5–10 seconds)
- Repository URL or "View on GitHub"
- Optional: call-to-action (e.g., "Star the repo", "Get started")

### Technical Specs
- **Resolution**: 1280×720 (720p) or 1920×1080 (1080p)
- **Frame rate**: 30 fps
- **Duration**: 30–90 seconds total
- **Format**: MP4 (H.264) for broad compatibility

## Part 3: Remotion Composition Structure

Structure your composition with:

```tsx
// Example composition structure
import { Composition } from 'remotion';
import { DemoVideo } from './DemoVideo';

export const RemotionRoot: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Composition
        id="DemoVideo"
        component={DemoVideo}
        durationInFrames={90 * 30}  // 90 seconds at 30fps
        fps={30}
        width={1280}
        height={720}
        defaultProps={{
          repoName: 'Your Repo Name',
          repoUrl: 'https://github.com/username/repo',
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

Use `useCurrentFrame()` and `interpolate()` for animations (fade-in, slide, etc.). Use `useVideoConfig()` for `durationInFrames`, `fps`, `width`, `height`.

---

## Part 4: Rendering the Video

1. **Render from the Remotion Studio**:
   - Click "Render" in the Studio UI
   - Choose composition, format (MP4), quality
   - Output path: e.g., `./demo.mp4` or `./assets/demo.mp4`

2. **Render from the command line**:
   ```bash
   npx remotion render src/index.ts DemoVideo out/demo.mp4
   ```

3. **Recommended output location**:
   - Place the video in the repository root or in a dedicated folder (e.g., `docs/`, `assets/`, or `demo/`)
   - Filename: `demo.mp4`, `demo-video.mp4`, or `README-demo.mp4`

---

## Part 5: Attaching the Video to the README

### Option A: Host on GitHub (recommended)
1. Add the video file to the repository (e.g., `demo/demo.mp4`)
2. Commit and push
3. Reference it in the README using a relative path or GitHub raw URL:

```markdown
## Demo

https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/assets/DEMO_VIDEO_ID/demo.mp4

<!-- Or use the video tag with relative path -->
<video src="demo/demo.mp4" width="720" controls></video>
```

**Note**: For GitHub, you can also upload the video via a PR or issue; GitHub will host it and provide a URL. Or use the `assets/` folder in a release.

### Option B: Relative path (for local viewing)
```markdown
## Demo

https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/raw/main/demo/demo.mp4

<!-- Or -->
![Demo Video](demo/demo.mp4)
```

### Option C: GIF alternative (smaller, no audio)
If file size is a concern, convert to GIF:
```bash
# Using ffmpeg
ffmpeg -i demo.mp4 -vf "fps=10,scale=720:-1:flags=lanczos" -c:v gif demo.gif
```
Then in README:
```markdown
![Demo](demo/demo.gif)
```

### README placement
- Add a "Demo" or "Quick Demo" section near the top (after the title/overview)
- Or immediately after "Running Locally" so users see the app in action before setup

---

## Part 6: Example README Section

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description of the project.

## Demo

Watch a short demo of the project in action:

https://github.com/username/repo/raw/main/demo/demo.mp4

<!-- Or with video tag for better control -->
<video src="demo/demo.mp4" width="720" controls>
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

---

## Part 7: Checklist

- [ ] Remotion project created and runs (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Composition built with opening, demo, and closing
- [ ] Video rendered to MP4 (720p or 1080p, 30fps)
- [ ] Video file added to repo (e.g., `demo/demo.mp4`)
- [ ] README updated with video link or embed
- [ ] Video plays correctly when viewing README on GitHub
- [ ] File size reasonable (< 10MB preferred for GitHub; consider GIF for very large videos)

## Part 8: Tips for Copyright Compendium Specifically

For this repository, the demo could show:
1. **Opening**: "Copyright Compendium – Navigable Web Version" (3–5 sec)
2. **Search**: Typing in the search box, selecting a result (5–8 sec)
3. **Navigation**: Using the side nav to jump between chapters (5–8 sec)
4. **Translation**: Toggling language (if that feature is prominent) (5–8 sec)
5. **Closing**: "View on GitHub" or repository URL (3–5 sec)

Use a screen recording of the live app, or recreate the UI in Remotion with static/mock content for a more polished look.
